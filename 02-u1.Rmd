### Activity: Reflective Journal {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

***Feel free to answer the questions above in your notes or Reflective Learning Journal***. 

<span class="blockhead">Introduction to the Reflective Journaling</span>

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning.  Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. 
The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. 
Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities. 

<details>
<summary>**Common Questions Used for Reflective Journaling** - Click to expand</summary> 

- In your view, what were the most important points in the readings, videoclips, or discussions with your peers?  
- What information did you already know?  
- What new knowledge, ideas, or perspectives have you gained?  
- What information was easy to remember or learn? Why?  
- What concepts did you find more difficult? Why?  
- How can you apply this knowledge to your work or current experience?  
- How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience?  
- Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts?  
- Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why?  
- If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be?  
- What further questions would like to ask the author of your readings?  
- What other articles, books or discussions would be of interest?  

*For any journal assignments in your courses, please refer to the specific questions and/or grading 
criteria to help you in your writing.*

## Personal Learning Environments 

<!-- adding content from LIDA - to be edited & personalized! -->
...

The primary purpose of this topic is to enable you to set up your course blog, which will form the hub of your Personal Learning Environment (PLE). 

Blog posts are a useful way of reflecting on your learning and a means to network with your peers. 
It also provides our learning community with a way to see how you are getting on and to help where we can.


The purpose of a PLE is to put the learner at the centre of the online learning environment, which will be enabled by establishing a personal blog for this course. Using a course blog:

You will retain control of your data and learning outputs generated during this online course, even after the course is completed.
You get to choose:
- The blog service you would like to use, although we recommend WordPress as it is supported by TWU.
- Whether to accept comments on your blog from your peers
- Whether to register your blog for the aggregated course feed so that any posts tagged with the course code (LiDA101) will be harvested for the feed.


A key teaching philosophy of this course is to embed the acquisition of new digital literacies 
into your learning journey. Knowledge of how to use the Internet and social media technologies 
will better prepare you for life in a digital world.

If this is your first time blogging, you should spend time in setting up your personal digital 
learning environment.

In this course, you will also use social media technologies to interact with fellow students. 
The advantage is that you will control and retain access to all the content and learning artefacts 
you create during this course, even after its conclusion.

Please remember that your course blog and the social media technologies you use on this course 
are public, and that you take full responsibility for anything you publish. 
Do not disclose any confidential information and respect the privacy of your employer, colleagues 
and friends. In short, don’t say anything that you would not want to read on the Internet.

### Activity: Setting up your course blog {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

As this is a course focusing on digital literacies, you are asked to establish 
a course blog, as this will improve your skills and enable you to network 
with your peers.   

We reccommend using WordPress, as it is supported by TWU.

Follow the steps below to set up your blog.

1. Register an account and create a free blog on WordPress.com.
1. Determine the difference between the dashboard used for editing and the published view of your blog. (It is important to know the difference because, when you register your blog for the course feed, you must use the url for the public view of your blog).
- Do you know how to open the published (public view) of your blog in a new window?
- Have you added a browser bookmark to your dashboard and public version of your blog?

1. Complete your personal details for display on the “About” page of your blog.
- Can you see the updates on your “about” page in the published view of your blog?

1. Review and customise your blog settings from the dashboard according to your preferences.
- We recommend that you enable categories and tags on your blog.
- Consider whether you want to moderate all comments or, in the case of WordPress, you can also enable previously approved posters to post comments without moderation. Conduct a web search on “moderating blog comments” to find out more about the pros and cons on the flow of information when moderating comments.

1. Visit the appearance option on your dashboard and personalise your blog by:
- Changing: your theme, header image, background colours and/or image
- Add at least one widget to your blog — remember “less is more“. One or two of the following are functional choices: Archives, recent posts, categories or category cloud, and blogs I follow.

1. Draft a blog post, reflecting on your experience of this e-Learning activity on creating a blog.
Click on “save draft” (so you can review before publishing live on the web). Your reflection could for example:
- Introduce yourself and reflect on what you would like to achieve by maintaining a blog to support your learning
- Reflect on what you thought of the activity; Was it easy or hard?
- Share links to any additional resources you found useful in completing the tasks.
- Provide tips for future learners who will be completing this activity. If you were to set up a new blog again, what would you do differently?
- Add anything your readers may find interesting or useful.

1. Choose a photo to add to your blog post. 
- Be sure you have permission to upload the photo.  We sugest using an open licence site, such as pixabay or...
- Alternatively, upload your own photo, take a selfie or ask someone to take a photo of you working on this blog post challenge.
- Optional: Record a short video introduction and embed this in your blog post.

1. Review your draft post and, when you’re happy with what you’ve written, click on the “Publish post” button.

1. Add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LiDA101

1. Post in the LDRS 101 Discourse forum to let your peers know the web address of your blog and ask them to post a comment. This will give you the opportunity to experience how comments function on your blog and to test if they are working properly.
