# Assignment 1: Reflective Journal {.unnumbered}

## Part 1: Reflective Journal {.unnumbered}

After completing Units 1-3, including the learning activities, you are asked to share your learning journal  as a 'work-in-progress' demonstrating the knowledge and skills you have gained thus far in the course. This assignment is based on the learning activities in Units 1-3 and is designed to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes (#1-4).

- First, examine the learning outcomes for each unit and ensure that your journal addresses each outcome. Include your thoughts from the learning activities and be sure to apply concepts to your experiences, evaluating your use of the digital skills presented. We are especially looking for your personal reflection on your learning process.
- Note that this is a chance to present your understanding and application of the course material, ask questions, clarify issues, and connect with your instructor(s). We are looking for evidence that you are engaging the course material and practicing the digital skills introduced.
- To help you make connections and develop your critical thinking skills, you are asked to include  a mind map of the three units. Mind maps are useful tools not only to organize your notes, but will help you process your learning in this course. You are encouraged to use Obsidian to complete this mind map. Be sure to submit the visitors and residents map from Unit 1.
- You will submit your journal, including  your mind map as part of Assignment 1.  You may also use your journal to meet the requirements of assignments 2 and 3, as each assignment builds on the skills learned in each unit.

How to share your Obsidian journal:

1. To submit your Obsidian vault, right click on your vault folder in your local file explorer and click Compress (on Macs) or Send To > Compressed (zipped) Folder (on PCs).
2. Once you have your zipped file, you can upload it to the Assignment 1 dropbox on Moodle.

## Part 2: Assessment Conversation {.unnumbered}

In addition to submitting your journal you will meet with your instructor for an assessment conversation to explain your learning process and demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes.

*Assessment Conversations will take place during Learning Lab times, so be sure to attend each session.*

*How to Prepare for Your Assessment Conversation*

1. Review the course learning outcomes (#1-4) and take notes on how you would explain your understanding of them.  This is an opportunity for self-reflection and assessment.
2. Review your journal entries: these should demonstrate how you have met the targeted course learning outcomes.
3. Review your mind map and your visitor and resident diagram and be able to show connections between concepts, apply concepts to your experiences or current events, and demonstrate personal reflection and critical thinking.

*Before the Assessment Conversation*

1. You will be meet with your instructor during Learning Lab sessions.  Be sure to test your video and audio in Zoom before the Learning Lab to be sure everything is working correctly.
2. Practice how to share your screen in Zoom, as well as sharing links in the chat. (See Helpful Tips section in [Zoom Basic Instructions](https://servicehub.twu.ca/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=101246){target="_blank"}.)

*During the Assessment Conversation:*

1. After a brief introduction, you will be asked a series of questions designed to measure your understanding of the course learning outcomes. 
2. During the conversation, make sure you clearly explain how your journal demonstrates your knowledge and skills related to the course outcomes.

::: note

*Note:* Do not read verbatim your assignments or reflections but highlight your key learning. For example: What do you want your instructor to notice? Which indicators of proficiency have been met? What are you especially proud of? How does your journal demonstrate evidence of learning?

3. Your instructor will provide you with feedback to help you assess whether or not you have met the proficiency criteria. They will also give suggestions for improvement and encouragement.
4. Take notes of the feedback and reflect on how you can continue to grow in each of the learning outcome areas.

## Assignment Feedback {.unnumbered}

Assignments are designed to demonstrate your level of understanding.  In this course we use proficiency scale as a gauge to help learners and the instructor ensure that assignments are written at an appropriate level.
