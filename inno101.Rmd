# Introduction to Digital Literacies for Online Learning

## Overview {-}

Welcome to Unit 1 of Learning with Technology! This course will introduce you to some ideas related to living, learning, and working in our digitally-saturated society. It is our intent to provide you with opportunities to start your university career with an emerging set of skills and literacies related to digital tools for learning. Within your academic pursuits, you will encounter a vast amount of information, and integrating digital tools into your learning journey might be difficult. Your chosen discipline will provide ample learning possibilities, and incorporating digital tools to enhance your learning may prove challenging. This course will give you a head start on using digital tools to build a workflow that will allow you to stay organized and to make your process of learning visible for yourself and your instructors. We will also lead you through readings and thoughts about your digital identity, privacy and security, and sharing your new knowledge in ethical ways.

<!--
//todo #2
-->

There will be two primary branches of the course and the tools that we will show you. The first branch will be a workflow that is private to you because it takes place primarily on your own computer, and the second branch is shared as publicly as you are comfortable sharing. You will have control over how public your work is, but we will think about the importance of sharing knowledge and how to do that easily and in ways that preserve your 'ownership' over your work.

During this first week, there will be both theoretical and practical work for you to do. In order to build a theoretical understanding of digital tools for learning, we will explore the idea of *the digital* in the context of contemporary society. At the same time, there are some important practicalites to manage in order to get set up for the course, so we will lead you through installing some apps on your computer that you will use extensively in this course, and which hopefully will become the backbone of your digital workflow throughout your time in higher education and beyond.

### Topics {-}

This unit is divided into the following topics:

2. Understanding the Digital
3. Digital Literacies
5. Digital Identity for Learning
6. Starting your Workflow


<!--

### Resources {-}

- All resources will be provided online in the unit.  


## Understanding the Digital

We begin Unit 1 with an introduction to the idea of *the digital*. You may recognize that digital tools are deeply embedded in modern society. It is not uncommon for people of all ages to interact with apps and tools that claim to connect people in conversations or networks, or to perform complex tasks for work, or to control various systems in our vehicles. Digital technology is really everywhere we look. Thinking about these tools is one way to conceptualize how we interact with digital tools, but we can also recognize that our social practices and norms have been impacted by digital tools. An example of this, at least in North America, is that the names of companies have become verbs. If people want to learn something about a topic, they *Google* it. It is deeper than that, though, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to many jurisdictions relying on mobile phones for allowing people to confirm their vaccination status in order to access restaurants or other public venues in the midst of restrictions creating barriers for those who don't have mobile phones. Mobile phones are often essential tools for communication, social media, internet browsing, messaging, entertainment, photography, navigation, online shopping, mobile banking, productivity, and health and fitness management. In other cases, such as in social media, it is almost impossible to participate in public discourse without access to technology. 

Modern universities are also deeply impacted by *the digital*. Every system involved in higher education has been digitized in some manner, including recruitment, accounting, and fundraising.  As you begin your university career, here are some digital systems you will likely encounter: 

- courses are designed and often delivered digitally, 
- course logistics (discussion forums, assignment submissions, quizzes, gradebooks) happen in large digital tools called learning management systems (LMS) or virtual learning environments (VLE) (e.g. Moodle), 
- assignments must often be created digitally (word processors, presentation software, video editors, website builders),
- research data is gathered, stored, analyzed, and shared digitally

There are many other processes and procedures that rely on *the digital* in higher education, but the important thing for you to realize as you begin your higher education journey is that there are many tools that you will be required to learn and use throughout your journey. Some are more obvious, like word processors, presentation software, email, the library website, and LMSs, but some are less obvious and won't necessarily be taught specifically, other than in this course.

Some of the digital tools we will introduce to you will help you build a *workflow* for you to manage the huge amount of information and resources that you will have to sort through to complete many of your assignments. You will learn to use AI to find *relevant* resources on whatever your topic might be. As you know from searching Google, a simple search of the web can turn up thousands or millions of hits, but there are tools that can help you highlight the 20 most relevant resources in just a few clicks. Once you find resources, we will show you tools that will allow you to track all your references, create citations in your writing quickly and easily, and then create a perfectly formatted reference list. Do not waste your time creating your own bibliographies! This one tool will save you days and likely weeks of work during your degree (quite literally). We will show you another tool that will allow you to make connections between ideas and notes so that you build a network of connected ideas. Curating this network of ideas is possibly one of the most useful things you can do in higher ed. You will end up with a searchable network of everything you've learned, and be able to visualize it at the click of a button. We will help you think through the implications of how you present yourself on the web so that you can make wise decisions about what you share and how you share it. We will also help you make connections on the web that could become a key resource for your learning and working in your career.

## Digital Literacies


> ::: {.definition name="Digital Literacy" #diglit}
Digital literacy is a person’s knowledge, skills, and abilities for using digital tools ethically, effectively, and within a variety of contexts in order to access, interpret, and evaluate information, as well as to create, construct new knowledge, and communicate with others. [@digitallearningadvisorycommitteePostSecondaryDigitalLearning2022]
:::

Literacy, as we commonly understand it, is the ability to *understand* the meaning of texts. It is more than just being able to 'read'. In the same way, digital literacy is the ability to make meaning using digital tools. It is more than simply being able to post to Instagram or TikTok, or whatever app you might use. As the definition above indicates, digital literacy involves using tools *ethically*, to *access, interpret, evaluate, create, construct, and communicate* information and knowledge.

One way to start thinking about digital literacy is to create a map of the apps and tools that you use, how you use them, and what traces of your presence you leave behind on the web. We call this a *Visitors and Residents Diagram*.


### Activity {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

***Feel free to answer the questions above in your notes or Reflective Learning Journal***. 

<span class="blockhead">Introduction to the Reflective Journaling</span>

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning.  Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities. 

<details>
<summary>**Common Questions Used for Reflective Journaling** - Click to expand</summary> 

- In your view, what were the most important points in the readings, videoclips, or discussions with your peers?  
- What information did you already know?  
- What new knowledge, ideas, or perspectives have you gained?  
- What information was easy to remember or learn? Why?  
- What concepts did you find more difficult? Why?  
- How can you apply this knowledge to your work or current experience?  
- How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience?  
- Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts?  
- Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why?  
- If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be?  
- What further questions would like to ask the author of your readings?  
- What other articles, books or discussions would be of interest?  

*For any journal assignments in your courses, please refer to the specific questions and/or grading 
criteria to help you in your writing.*

<!-- @cmadland, I'm moving the PLE, blog, & digital footprint sections to unit 4 -->




## Digital Literacies

In this unit we've started discussing 'the digital', you have started a blog (part of your PLN), and you've examined your own digital identity.  In our final topic, we want to begin to define digital literacies, and continue to build digital skills.

So, what is digital literacy?  In the next activity, you will start to unpack this term and prepare your own initial definition of digital literacy.

### Activity: Definining Digital Literacy {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Purpose: Search for definitions of digital literacy and digital skills on the web to identify the difference.

1. Read Wikipedia’s definition of [Digital literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy) – Is this a good description?
1. Scan the [#diglit](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login?redirect_after_login=%2Fhashtag%2Fdiglit%3Fs%3D03) hashtag on Twitter – Did you find any valuable links to defining digital literacy?
1. Conduct a Google search for “digital literacy.” Select a few definitions you like and record the urls, for example by adding these to your browser bookmarks.
1. Conduct a Google search for “digital skills.” Select one or two definitions you like and record the urls.
1. Conduct a Google search for “digital fluency” Select one or two definitions.
1. What are the differences between digital literacies, digital fluency, and digital skills? How are these concepts related?
1. Read: [What is digital literacy?](http://pomo.com.au/blog/digital-literacy/) published by POMO – Is this a reliable source?
1. How would you rate the academic quality of the definitions you found (e.g. low / high quality)?
1. What did you discover? Share your thoughts and experiences by posting on the LDRS101 Discourse channel.  For example:

- The major difference between digital skills and literacies is …
- I didn’t realise that …
- For me, digital literacy means …”

Note: Your comment will be displayed in the course feed.

### Digital skills versus literacies

“Saying that any digital tool teaches us digital literacies is like saying a pen or a keyboard teaches us writing.”
—Maha Bali
@Bali_Maha


"Digital literacies are not solely about technical proficiency but about the issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose.”
—Doug Belshaw, Educational researcher



### Activity: Digital skills versus literacies {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity, we will review an article on the difference between digital skills and digital literacies using Hypothes.is – an online social annotation technology.


Purpose
Read an online article and annotate it using Hypothes.is.

Tasks

```



### Activity: Researching a definition {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}


This course is facilitated and enabled by resources that learners can access on the Internet. This involves the ability to search, evaluate, and select resources to support your learning. A key feature of a PLE is the ability to share useful and valuable information with your peers.

In this activity, you will complete your first resource bank activity, where you are invited to search for additional resources to help you refine and develop your own definition of digital literacies, and to reflect on how this differs from definitions for digital skills. The resource bank activity builds on your initial search on the previous page by inviting you to share links to valuable resources you source on the Internet. The resource bank provides the technology to share these resources with our LDRS 101 learning community.

The resource bank for this course is hosted on ...(Obsidian? Evernote? Moodle wiki? Google doc?) is an open source social bookmarking application which enables users to share and annotate links to resources they find on the web. It uses a tag system to group resources according to different topics. The tag system helps users to locate links to resources on the site using the same tag.

The purpose of this activity is to find and select online definitions for digital literacies and digital skills, and to record and share these links using the OERu resource bank. This activity is designed to give you the opportunity to familiarise yourself with our shared resource bank, which is hosted on the bookmarks.oeru.org site. Note the format of the resource bank activity; in particular, scroll down to the footnote area at the bottom of this activity to see the required and recommended tags.

### Activity: Forum – Why digital literacy matters {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

A key component of digital literacy and networked learning relates to the ability to engage meaningfully in online learning communities.

This learning activity will provide you with the opportunity to familiarise yourself with the Moodle discussion boards that are common in TWU online learning discussions.


Purpose of discussion activity:
To reflect on the reasons why digital literacy matters to you, and to demonstrate your digital skills using a discussion forum.

TWU online courses often use Moodle discussion forums as the main discussion platform for learners to engage in course conversations asyncrhonously. 

- info re oeru forums - replace with Discourse?
This is a community managed platform using the open source Discourse software. The system awards badges for a range of activities. Authentic activity increases the user’s trust levels which will enable more software features for participants as your trust levels increase over time. Therefore it’s a good time to get started in earning your first badges and improving your trust levels early in the course.

Watch the following video and jot down the reasons why digital literacy matters to you, then complete the steps which follow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2k3C-iB88w&t=3s
update video?

Steps

1. Log in to forums.oeru.org (Sign up to register a new account if your don’t already have one.)
1. Complete your profile page (Click on your user icon on the top right-hand side of your screen and select the settings cog ().)
1. Spend a few minutes to explore the badges you can earn on the discourse platform. (Click on the badge for details.) By the end of this learning pathway you should have attained the following badges:
- Autobiographer
- First-like
- First mention
- First quote
1. Post a contribution to the discussion on digital literacies and why they are important for you
1. Remember to post one or two replies to interesting contributions (You should also “like” good contributions, use @username when replying, and if appropriate quote a reply when responding.)


```

### Assessment and scope of digital literacies

Digital literacies for academic learning involves more than Facebook, Snapchat or Twitter and the associated technical skills in using these technologies. 

As you explore the concept, you will find online resources which confuse digital skills with digital literacies. The activities which follow aim to provide an initial introduction to the wide range of digital literacies associated with academic learning. We will explore the concept of digital literacies in greater depth as we progress with the course. When exploring these online resources, we encourage you to differentiate between skills and literacies and to develop a critical disposition. Digtial literacies involve issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose. However, these literacies are closely related to technical proficiency in using a range of digital applications

### Activity: Am I Digitally Literate? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Digital literacies encompasses a wide range of capabilities which extend beyond the digital skills associated with different technologies.

1. Study the graphic depicting the Seven elements of digital literacies (scroll down the page to view the graphic). (replace)
1. Jot down one or more technologies or tools you would recommend for each of the seven elements in the graphic and assess your competence in using each particular technology/tool (eg below average, average, above average and excellent).

1. Next, use your searching skills to discover the range and scope of digital literacies (Don’t spend more than 15 to 20 minutes on the self-assessment activity).

- Conduct a Google search using: “digital literacy self-assessment”
- Choose a link to conduct a self-assessment of your digital literacy.
Alternatively, you can:
- Try the iTest developed by the University of Exeter or
- Explore the What is digital literacy? page of the Digital Literacies Toolkit developed by the University of Southampton.

Questions to consider

- Did the self-assessment you chose focus on digital skills or digital literacies?
- What did you learn from this exercise?
- Share your thoughts by posting on Discourse:

Note: Your comment will be displayed in the course feed.

# Unit 4: Building a Network of Ideas

## Overview {-}

Welcome to Unit 4! In the previous units, you've been introduced to the world of digital literacies and how to use various tools for organizing and connecting ideas. You have started to build a workflow to help you learn more effectively, and have applied the critical skill of metacognition to explain your process for learning. 

Now, let's delve into the next phase of our learning journey.

In the second half of the course, you will continue to build your digital skills and use critical thinking to record your learning process. Our attention will move from creating a personal collection of ideas to presenting your learning in a more open platform. Remember, you decide how public you want to be. We'll also consider why sharing knowledge is important and explore user-friendly ways to do so while still maintaining your control over your work and handling privacy matters. During this unit, you'll get the chance to create a blog, discover your digital footprint, and assess various digital tools.

### Topics {-}

This unit is divided into the following topics:


1. Personal Learning Environments 
1. My Digital Footprint
1. Evaluating Digital Tools

<!--
//todo #4

## Personal Learning Environments 

The primary purpose of this topic is to enable you to set up your course blog, which will form the hub of your Personal Learning Environment (PLE). Blog posts are a useful way of reflecting on your learning and a means to network with your peers. It also provides our TWU learning community with a way to see how you are engaging with the course and to help where we can. The purpose of a PLE is to put the learner at the centre of the online learning environment, which will be enabled by establishing a personal blog for this course. 

So what is a Personal Learning Environment?

> 'Personal Learning Environments are systems that help learners take control of and manage their own learning. This includes providing support for learners to set their own learning goals, manage their learning; managing both content and process, communicate with others in the process of learning, and thereby achieve learning goals. A PLE may be composed of one or more sub-systems: As such it may be a desktop application, or composed of one or more web-based services.' [PLE Wiki](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Personal_learning_environment)

 A Personal Learning Environment is "a structure and process that helps learners organize the influx of information, resources and interactions that they are faced with on a daily basis into a personalized learning space or experience. In a PLE, the learner develops an individualized digital identity through the perceptual cues and cognitive affordances that the personal learning environment provides, such as what information to share and when, who to share it with, and how to effectively merge formal and informal learning experiences ([Castañeda, Cosgrave, Marín, Cronin, 2016](https://naerjournal.ua.es/article/view/v6n1-introduction#)) cited in [Personal Learning Environments: Research-Based Practices, Frameworks and Challenges](https://naerjournal.ua.es/article/view/v6n1-introduction).

What elements of the two definitions resonate with you?  How do you manage you own learning? What are your learning goals? How do you organize your daily interations and influx of information?

In this first activity, you will gain first hand experience in using blog technology for publishing your own course site. You will “declare” yourself online using your PLE (as an alternative to posting an introduction in a closed course forum typically used in a conventional e-Learning course). Note that TWU online courses often use Moodle Discussion Forums to facilitate conversations.  By using a platform such as Wordpress, you can retain the contents of your posts, as well as the comments of your peers.  In an LMS (Learning Management System) such as Moodle, you may lose access to what you have posted in discussions, and more importantly, conversations with your peers.  As you create your personal blog in WordPress (or your own selective blog site), you control your data and who can see it.


Using a course blog:

You will retain control of your data and learning outputs generated during this online course, even after the course is completed.
You get to choose:

- The blog service you would like to use, although **we recommend WordPress as it is supported by TWU**.
- Whether to accept comments on your blog from your peers
- Whether to register your blog for the aggregated course feed so that any posts tagged with the course code (LDRS101) will be harvested for the feed.


A key teaching philosophy of this course is to embed the acquisition of new digital literacies into your learning journey. Knowledge of how to use the Internet and social media technologies will better prepare you for life in a digital world. If this is your first time blogging, you should spend time in setting up your personal digital learning environment. The advantage of a WordPress blog is that you will control and retain access to all the content and learning artefacts you create during this course, even after its conclusion. Please remember that your course blog and the social media technologies you use on this course are public, and that you take full responsibility for anything you publish. Do not disclose any confidential information and respect the privacy of your employer, colleagues and friends. In short, don’t say anything that you would not want to read on the Internet.

### Activity: Setting up your course blog {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

As this is a course focusing on digital literacies, you are asked to establish a course blog, as this will improve your skills and enable you to network with your peers. We recommend using WordPress, as it is supported by TWU.

Follow the steps below to set up your blog.

1. Register an account and create a free blog on WordPress.com.
1. Determine the difference between the dashboard used for editing and the published view of your blog. (It is important to know the difference because, when you register your blog for the course feed, you must use the url for the public view of your blog).
- Do you know how to open the published (public view) of your blog in a new window?
- Have you added a browser bookmark to your dashboard and public version of your blog?

1. Complete your personal details for display on the “About” page of your blog.
- Can you see the updates on your “about” page in the published view of your blog?

1. Review and customise your blog settings from the dashboard according to your preferences.
- We recommend that you enable categories and tags on your blog.
- Consider whether you want to moderate all comments or, in the case of WordPress, you can also enable previously approved posters to post comments without moderation. Conduct a web search on “moderating blog comments” to find out more about the pros and cons on the flow of information when moderating comments.

1. Visit the appearance option on your dashboard and personalise your blog by:
- Changing: your theme, header image, background colours and/or image
- Add at least one widget to your blog — remember “less is more“. One or two of the following are functional choices: Archives, recent posts, categories or category cloud, and blogs I follow.

1. Draft a blog post, reflecting on your experience of this e-Learning activity on creating a blog.
Click on “save draft” (so you can review before publishing live on the web). Your reflection could for example:
- Introduce yourself and reflect on what you would like to achieve by maintaining a blog to support your learning
- Reflect on what you thought of the activity; Was it easy or hard?
- Share links to any additional resources you found useful in completing the tasks.
- Provide tips for future learners who will be completing this activity. If you were to set up a new blog again, what would you do differently?
- Add anything your readers may find interesting or useful.

1. Choose a photo to add to your blog post. 
- Be sure you have permission to upload the photo.  We sugest using an open licence site, such as pixabay or...
- Alternatively, upload your own photo, take a selfie or ask someone to take a photo of you working on this blog post challenge.
- Optional: Record a short video introduction and embed this in your blog post.

1. Review your draft post and, when you’re happy with what you’ve written, click on the “Publish post” button.

1. Add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LDRS101

1. Post in the LDRS 101 Discourse forum to let your peers know the web address of your blog and ask them to post a comment. This will give you the opportunity to experience how comments function on your blog and to test if they are working properly.

## Online Identity for Learning 

add intro paragraph

[Your digital footprint matters](https://www.internetsociety.org/learning/digital-footprints/), published by the Internet Society.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro_LlRg8rGg&t=1s - Four Reasons to Care About Your Digital Footprint



Julia Angwin, author of “Dragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security, and Freedom in a World of Relentless Surveillance” attempted to erase her digital footprint.

...

### Activity: Digital Footprint Audit {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity you will audit your own digital footprint in order to find out what exists on the internet about you, and reflect on what you want your online identity to be.  Follow the steps below to begin.

1. Conduct a Google search of your own name (using an incognito or private window in Chrome or Firefox). Search for your first name and surname without parenthesis (for example: snow white) and then with parenthesis (for example: “snow white”). Explore the results of your search.
1. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of current and previous employers.
1. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of previous schools you attended.
1. Expand your search to include social media sites, for example: “snow white” twitter; “snow white” facebook; “snow white” youtube etc.
1. Note any interesting or surprising findings.

<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider</span>

After watching the video, consider the following:

- ...

```



### Activity: Blog: My Digital Footprint {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Prepare and publish a short blog post of about 250 to 300 words focusing on what you hope to achieve with your online digital identity for learning. Your post can include:

1. Optional reflection: You may want to include a reflection(s) on the outcomes of your footprint audit. Remember that your blog post is public, so only share what you are comfortable sharing with the world. You don’t need to be specific; for example, you can generalise: I am satisfied with my digital footprint because … or I would like to improve my digital footprint for learning because …

1. Professional versus private: Consider how you want to separate your “private” online identity from your professional and / or learning identity. If you already maintain an online presence (existing blog, twitter and/or facebook accounts) think about how you will separate professional / learning posts from private and social life interactions online. For example, maintaining a separate course or learning blog is one way to achieve this distinction. Will you link your personal online identities (e.g.an existing Twitter username or Facebook account) with your learning blog? Will you link your professional online identity (e.g. published online biography on your employer’s web site) with your learning blog?

1. Objectives: List a few objectives for developing or improving your online identity.

1. Remember to add a category or tag to your post using the course tag: LDRS101 (This is needed to harvest links to posts from registered course blogs for the course feed.)

Remember: You are in charge of what you post online and deciding what you would like to share for your digital identity for the purposes of this course. Don’t share high risk personal details like physical address, date of birth, name of first pet etc., which may make it easier for identity thieves to appear more credible. If unsure, consult online resources for internet safety; for example Netsafe New Zealand. (replace resource)

!! Note that we will cover online identity in more depth in Unit 5.
