### Course Technologies{-}

This course is about learning with technology. Digital literacies are closely linked but not limited to digital skills. Consequently, this course will use a number of different online communication and publishing technologies to support your learning.

#### An open philosophy of inclusion {-}

Learning in a digital age incorporates a wide range of online technologies and software applications. The OERu has a strong commitment to free and open source software because we believe that no learner should be denied access to learning for lack of funds to purchase a proprietary software license.  Nor do we believe that you should be forced to sacrifice your freedoms in software choice.

The OERu course resources and interaction technologies are based entirely on free and open source software and you will be able to complete all the learning activities using open source applications without the need to purchase any software. You are free to use proprietary technology applications of your choice, but you can also use this course to explore and experiment with open technology.

#### Summary of technologies used on this course {-}

You do not need a password to access the course materials. However, if you want to post comments and /or receive instructions via email you will need to register an account on the course site by clicking on the “head graphic” at the top of your screen.

Your registration login details will provide you with authenticated access to most of the course technologies hosted by OERu. In some cases you will need to register separate accounts for technologies that are run independently of the LiDA course.

The following table provides a summary of the main technologies used in this course.

| **Technology**       | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

# Introduction to Digital Literacies for Online Learning

## Overview {-}

Welcome to Unit 1 of Learning with Technology! This course will introduce you to some ideas related to living, learning, and working in our digitally-saturated society. It is our intent to provide you with opportunities to start your university career with an emerging set of skills and literacies related to digital tools for learning. Within your academic pursuits, you will encounter a vast amount of information, and integrating digital tools into your learning journey might be difficult. Your chosen discipline will provide ample learning possibilities, and incorporating digital tools to enhance your learning may prove challenging. This course will give you a head start on using digital tools to build a workflow that will allow you to stay organized and to make your process of learning visible for yourself and your instructors. We will also lead you through readings and thoughts about your digital identity, privacy and security, and sharing your new knowledge in ethical ways.

<!--
//todo #2
-->

There will be two primary branches of the course and the tools that we will show you. The first branch will be a workflow that is private to you because it takes place primarily on your own computer, and the second branch is shared as publicly as you are comfortable sharing. You will have control over how public your work is, but we will think about the importance of sharing knowledge and how to do that easily and in ways that preserve your 'ownership' over your work.

During this first week, there will be both theoretical and practical work for you to do. In order to build a theoretical understanding of digital tools for learning, we will explore the idea of *the digital* in the context of contemporary society. At the same time, there are some important practicalites to manage in order to get set up for the course, so we will lead you through installing some apps on your computer that you will use extensively in this course, and which hopefully will become the backbone of your digital workflow throughout your time in higher education and beyond.

### Topics {-}

This unit is divided into the following topics:

1. Understanding the Digital  
1. Digital Literacies  
1. Digital Privacy and safety

## Understanding the Digital

We begin Unit 1 with an introduction to the idea of *the digital*. You may recognize that digital tools are deeply embedded in modern society. It is not uncommon for people of all ages to interact with apps and tools that claim to connect people in conversations or networks, or to perform complex tasks for work, or to control various systems in our vehicles. Digital technology is really everywhere we look. Thinking about these tools is one way to conceptualize how we interact with digital tools, but we can also recognize that our social practices and norms have been impacted by digital tools. An example of this, at least in North America, is that the names of companies have become verbs. If people want to learn something about a topic, they *Google* it. It is deeper than that, though, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to many jurisdictions relying on mobile phones for allowing people to confirm their vaccination status in order to access restaurants or other public venues in the midst of restrictions creating barriers for those who don't have mobile phones. Mobile phones are often essential tools for communication, social media, internet browsing, messaging, entertainment, photography, navigation, online shopping, mobile banking, productivity, and health and fitness management. In other cases, such as in social media, it is almost impossible to participate in public discourse without access to technology. 

Modern universities are also deeply impacted by *the digital*. Every system involved in higher education has been digitized in some manner, including recruitment, accounting, and fundraising.  As you begin your university career, here are some digital systems you will likely encounter: 

- courses are designed and often delivered digitally, 
- course logistics (discussion forums, assignment submissions, quizzes, gradebooks) happen in large digital tools called learning management systems (LMS) or virtual learning environments (VLE) (e.g. Moodle), 
- assignments must often be created digitally (word processors, presentation software, video editors, website builders),
- research data is gathered, stored, analyzed, and shared digitally

There are many other processes and procedures that rely on *the digital* in higher education, but the important thing for you to realize as you begin your higher education journey is that there are many tools that you will be required to learn and use throughout your journey. Some are more obvious, like word processors, presentation software, email, the library website, and LMSs, but some are less obvious and won't necessarily be taught specifically, other than in this course.

Some of the digital tools we will introduce to you will help you build a *workflow* for you to manage the huge amount of information and resources that you will have to sort through to complete many of your assignments. You will learn to use AI to find *relevant* resources on whatever your topic might be. As you know from searching Google, a simple search of the web can turn up thousands or millions of hits, but there are tools that can help you highlight the 20 most relevant resources in just a few clicks. Once you find resources, we will show you tools that will allow you to track all your references, create citations in your writing quickly and easily, and then create a perfectly formatted reference list. Do not waste your time creating your own bibliographies! This one tool will save you days and likely weeks of work during your degree (quite literally). We will show you another tool that will allow you to make connections between ideas and notes so that you build a network of connected ideas. Curating this network of ideas is possibly one of the most useful things you can do in higher ed. You will end up with a searchable network of everything you've learned, and be able to visualize it at the click of a button. We will help you think through the implications of how you present yourself on the web so that you can make wise decisions about what you share and how you share it. We will also help you make connections on the web that could become a key resource for your learning and working in your career.

## Digital Literacies


> ::: {.definition name="Digital Literacy" #diglit}
Digital literacy is a person’s knowledge, skills, and abilities for using digital tools ethically, effectively, and within a variety of contexts in order to access, interpret, and evaluate information, as well as to create, construct new knowledge, and communicate with others. [@digitallearningadvisorycommitteePostSecondaryDigitalLearning2022]
:::

Literacy, as we commonly understand it, is the ability to *understand* the meaning of texts. It is more than just being able to 'read'. In the same way, digital literacy is the ability to make meaning using digital tools. It is more than simply being able to post to Instagram or TikTok, or whatever app you might use. As the definition above indicates, digital literacy involves using tools *ethically*, to *access, interpret, evaluate, create, construct, and communicate* information and knowledge.



>“In today’s world, being literate requires much, much more than the traditional literacy of yesterday.”
>—Rebecca Alber

Traditionally, literacy was about speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literacy has taken on a much broader and complex meaning. Today there’s also digital literacy, media literacy, new literacy etc. In this signpost you are invited to reflect on how your literacies have changed, when compared to your parents and to speculate on new literacies the next generation of learners may need for the future.

### Activity {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

<span class="blockhead">Reflection on the 21st century learner</span>

The following video, published by the MacArthur Foundation, questions how digital media are changing the way young people learn, play, socialize, and participate in civic life. John Seely Brown a researcher with particular interests in radical innovation and digital culture suggests that today’s gaming oriented children want to be measured and feel that if they are not learning, it is not fun. How does this relate to how you feel about learning?

Watch the video and think about:

- What “literacy” skills have you acquired when compared to your parents?  
- What “literacy” skills will be important for future learners in higher education?

Reflect on the following writing prompts:

- My parents did not need to …  
- A new literacy I acquired is the ability to …  
- Higher education students of the future will need to …  
- … is an important 21st century skill for future employment  

You could jot down your responses in your notes, whatever form that may take (paper journal, word document, other app).  However, stay turned and we'll show you a tool we think will be a game changer in your academic studies!

```

One way to start thinking about digital literacy is to create a map of the apps and tools that you use, how you use them, and what traces of your presence you leave behind on the web. We call this a *Visitors and Residents Diagram*. To complete this activity, you will need to do a little bit of setup, as follows.

### Activity {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

<span class="blockhead">Install Obsidian</span>

Obsidian is a free and open source note-taking and mind-mapping app.

1. Go to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/download){target="_blank"} and [follow these instructions to install Obsidian on your computer.](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian){target="_blank"}
    - It is recommended that you use a computer, rather than a mobile phone to install Obsidian, but please let your instructor or facilitator know if you are on mobile.
    - You do NOT need to purchase any upgrades such as **Obsidian Sync** or **Obsidian Publish**.
2. Work through the **Getting Started** section of the Obsidian help pages starting with **[Create a vault](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault){target="_blank"}**.
    - When you create the vault in this step, we recommend that you name it **TWU** or something similar. Later, you can create as many vaults as you would like.
3. It is recommended that you [use one of the sync services listed here](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Sync+your+notes+across+devices){target="_blank"} so that your files are backed up.   

```

Obsidian will become a backbone of this course as we will use it to learn how the web works and give you a workflow that will help you stay organized. One of the advantages of Obsidian is that everything you do in the app happens on your own computer, rather than *the cloud*, which is just another way of saying *someone else's computer*. However, the drawback to that is that you need to ensure that you have a backup of your vaults in a secure location, either one of the sync services mentioned in step 3, above, or another backup system. [Please check the Learning Hub](https://twu.discourse.group/c/ldrs101/10){target="_blank"} or talk your your instructor or facilitator for help with this.

To give you a head start, we have created a **starter vault** for you to download and use. Follow the instructions below to access the starter vault.

```{block2, type='reflect'}

<span class="blockhead">Download the Starter Vault</span>

1. [Click this link to download the vault.](https://github.com/twu-innovation/ldrs101-vault/archive/refs/heads/main.zip){target="_blank"}
    - This will download a file called `ldrs101-vault-main.zip` to your computer.
2. Move the file to your `Documents` folder.
3. Unzip or extract the contents of the file.
4. Rename the folder to `ldrs101`.
5. Open the **Obsidian** app and click the `Open another vault` icon in the bottom left corner.

![screenshot of the 'open another vault' button](assets/digital-literacy/obsidian2.png)

6. Choose the `ldrs101` folder, and then Obsidian will ask you to trust this vault. Click 'Trust author and enable plugins'.
7. Once you are in the vault, feel free to take a look around. You will notice a `HOME` page, a `Tools` folder with some files in it, and a `VR Diagram Canvas`.

We have created a sample VR Diagram in the vault. Your task is to create your own VR Diagram, as explained below.

```

***Feel free to answer the questions above in your notes or Reflective Learning Journal***. 

<span class="blockhead">Introduction to the Reflective Journaling</span>

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning.  Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities. 

<details>
<summary>**Common Questions Used for Reflective Journaling** - Click to expand</summary> 

- In your view, what were the most important points in the readings, videoclips, or discussions with your peers?  
- What information did you already know?

<!-- @cmadland, I'm moving the PLE, blog, & digital footprint sections to unit 4 -->




## Digital Literacies

In this unit we've started discussing 'the digital', you have started a blog (part of your PLN), and you've examined your own digital identity.  In our final topic, we want to begin to define digital literacies, and continue to build digital skills.

So, what is digital literacy?  In the next activity, you will start to unpack this term and prepare your own initial definition of digital literacy.

### Activity: Definining Digital Literacy {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Purpose: Search for definitions of digital literacy and digital skills on the web to identify the difference.

1. Read Wikipedia’s definition of [Digital literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy){target="_blank"} – Is this a good description?
1. Scan the [#diglit](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login?redirect_after_login=%2Fhashtag%2Fdiglit%3Fs%3D03){target="_blank"} hashtag on X (Twitter) – Did you find any valuable links to defining digital literacy?
1. Conduct a Google search for “digital literacy.” Select a few definitions you like and record the urls, for example by adding these to your browser bookmarks.
1. Conduct a Google search for “digital skills.” Select one or two definitions you like and record the urls.
1. Conduct a Google search for “digital fluency” Select one or two definitions.
1. What are the differences between digital literacies, digital fluency, and digital skills? How are these concepts related?
1. Read: [What is digital literacy?](http://pomo.com.au/blog/digital-literacy/){target="_blank"} published by POMO – Is this a reliable source?
1. How would you rate the academic quality of the definitions you found (e.g. low / high quality)?
1. What did you discover? Share your thoughts and experiences by posting on the LDRS101 Discourse channel.  For example:

- The major difference between digital skills and literacies is …
- I didn’t realise that …
- For me, digital literacy means …”

Note: Your comment will be displayed in the course feed.

```


### Digital skills versus literacies

“Saying that any digital tool teaches us digital literacies is like saying a pen or a keyboard teaches us writing.”
—Maha Bali
@Bali_Maha


"Digital literacies are not solely about technical proficiency but about the issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose.”
—Doug Belshaw, Educational researcher



### Activity: Digital skills versus literacies {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity, we will review an article on the difference between digital skills and digital literacies using Hypothes.is – an online social annotation technology.


Purpose
Read an online article and annotate it using Hypothes.is.

Tasks

1. Read the Hypothes.is “Quick start guide for students”
1. Create an account on Hypothes.is. Here is the registration link
We recommend that you use the Chrome browser (download here) and install the Hypothes.is extension. Alternatively, you can annotate web pages directly from the Hypothes.is website by pasting the link into the text area after you have logged into the site. If you are working on a mobile device, please follow these instructions: How to use Hypothes.is on mobile devices.
1. Read the following article: Knowing the Difference Between Digital Skills and Digital Literacies, and Teaching Both
1. Activate the annotations after logging in to Hypothes.is and click on the search icon () and enter the course code (LiDA101) to filter posts for this course from the public feed.
1. Annotate or reply to posts by visiting the annotation page (You will need to be logged into the Hypothes.is site to post.)
1. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS101 (The course tag is required to harvest posts for the course feed.)

```



### Activity: Researching a definition {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}


This course is facilitated and enabled by resources that learners can access on the Internet. This involves the ability to search, evaluate, and select resources to support your learning. A key feature of a PLE is the ability to share useful and valuable information with your peers.

In this activity, you will complete your first resource bank activity, where you are invited to search for additional resources to help you refine and develop your own definition of digital literacies, and to reflect on how this differs from definitions for digital skills. The resource bank activity builds on your initial search on the previous page by inviting you to share links to valuable resources you source on the Internet. The resource bank provides the technology to share these resources with our LDRS 101 learning community.

The resource bank for this course is hosted on ...(Obsidian? Evernote? Moodle wiki? Google doc?) is an open source social bookmarking application which enables users to share and annotate links to resources they find on the web. It uses a tag system to group resources according to different topics. The tag system helps users to locate links to resources on the site using the same tag.

The purpose of this activity is to find and select online definitions for digital literacies and digital skills, and to record and share these links using the OERu resource bank. This activity is designed to give you the opportunity to familiarise yourself with our shared resource bank, which is hosted on the bookmarks.oeru.org site. Note the format of the resource bank activity; in particular, scroll down to the footnote area at the bottom of this activity to see the required and recommended tags.

Tasks

**Search**
1. Conduct a general Google search to find a few definitions for digital literacies and digital skills (narrow your search to three or four resources you find valuable for both concepts.)
**Select**
1. Select the best resource link for each concept – think about why you chose these links.
**Create an account on bookmarks**
1. Click on the register link on bookmarks.oeru.org
1. The code you need for the anti-spam question is contained in the instructions for Session 1.
1. For additional help in using bookmarks, consult the support site.
**Record, annotate and tag your bookmarks**
1. Log in to bookmarks.oeru.org and click on the “Add” link to record your best resource link describing digital literacies, and your best resource link for describing digital skills.
1. Remember to add the required tags and suggested tags (see below in the footnote area).
- Notes about tags: Tags should be lowercase without spaces. When adding more than one tag, these should be separated using commas. The lida101a2-1 refers to the first activity of the second learning pathway of the lida101 course.
- Important: Remember to make your bookmark public (this is located next to the privacy section in the edit window when adding a bookmark).
1. Include a short description summarising the link, including why you recommend the resource.
**Explore the bookmark tags for digital literacy and digital skills**
1. Click on the “Tags” link located at the top of the page at bookmarks.oeru.org.
1. Search for resources tagged: digital literacy, or with the activity number: lida101a2-1 (Note, remember to select “all bookmarks” so that your search is not restricted to your own bookmarks.)
1. Explore a few bookmarks which have been submitted by fellow learners. If you find a resource you like, vote for the resource by clicking on the “thumbs-up” graphic. Click on the “copy” link to add useful bookmarks to your personal bookmark account on bookmarks.oeru.org
1. Search for resources tagged: digital skills (Remember to select “all bookmarks”).
1. Explore a few bookmarks which have been submitted by fellow learners, and vote for those that you find useful.


```

### Activity: Forum – Why digital literacy matters {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

A key component of digital literacy and networked learning relates to the ability to engage meaningfully in online learning communities.

This learning activity will provide you with the opportunity to familiarise yourself with the Moodle discussion boards that are common in TWU online learning discussions.

Purpose of discussion activity:
To reflect on the reasons why digital literacy matters to you, and to demonstrate your digital skills using a discussion forum.

TWU online courses often use Moodle discussion forums as the main discussion platform for learners to engage in course conversations asyncrhonously. 

- info re oeru forums - replace with Discourse?
This is a community managed platform using the open source Discourse software. The system awards badges for a range of activities. Authentic activity increases the user’s trust levels which will enable more software features for participants as your trust levels increase over time. Therefore it’s a good time to get started in earning your first badges and improving your trust levels early in the course.

Watch the following video and jot down the reasons why digital literacy matters to you, then complete the steps which follow.

(Watch: *Digital literacy and why it matters*)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2k3C-iB88w]{target="_blank"}

</div>

**Steps**

1. Log in to forums.oeru.org (Sign up to register a new account if your don’t already have one.)  
1. Complete your profile page (Click on your user icon on the top right-hand side of your screen and select the settings cog).  
1. Spend a few minutes to explore the badges you can earn on the discourse platform. (Click on the badge for details.) By the end of this learning pathway you should have attained the following badges:  
   - Autobiographer  
   - First-like  
   - First mention  
   - First quote  
1. Post a contribution to the discussion on digital literacies and why they are important for you  
1. Remember to post one or two replies to interesting contributions (You should also “like” good contributions, use @username when replying, and if appropriate quote a reply when responding.)  

```

### Assessment and scope of digital literacies {-}

Digital literacies for academic learning involves more than Facebook, Snapchat or Twitter and the associated technical skills in using these technologies. 

As you explore the concept, you will find online resources which confuse digital skills with digital literacies. The activities which follow aim to provide an initial introduction to the wide range of digital literacies associated with academic learning. We will explore the concept of digital literacies in greater depth as we progress with the course. When exploring these online resources, we encourage you to differentiate between skills and literacies and to develop a critical disposition. Digtial literacies involve issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose. However, these literacies are closely related to technical proficiency in using a range of digital applications

### Activity: Am I Digitally Literate? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Digital literacies encompasses a wide range of capabilities which extend beyond the digital skills associated with different technologies.

1. Study the graphic depicting the Seven elements of digital literacies (scroll down the page to view the graphic). (replace)  
1. Jot down one or more technologies or tools you would recommend for each of the seven elements in the graphic and assess your competence in using each particular technology/tool (eg below average, average, above average and excellent).  
1. Next, use your searching skills to discover the range and scope of digital literacies (Don’t spend more than 15 to 20 minutes on the self-assessment activity).  
   - Conduct a Google search using: “digital literacy self-assessment”  
   - Choose a link to conduct a self-assessment of your digital literacy.  
   - **Alternatively, you can:**  
   - Try the iTest developed by the University of Exeter **or**  
   - Explore the What is digital literacy? page of the Digital Literacies Toolkit developed by the University of Southampton.  

<span class="blockhead">Questions to consider</span>

- Did the self-assessment you chose focus on digital skills or digital literacies?
- What did you learn from this exercise?
- Share your thoughts by posting on Discourse:

**Note:** Your comment will be displayed in the course feed.

### Digital Privacy & Safety

Now that you have assessed  some of your digital skills or literacies, let's focus our attention on privacy and safety. In this section we summarize important practices as a reminder to remain vigilant in protecting your privacy and security online. If you are unsure about good security practices, there are a wealth of online resources you can (and should) consult.  

#### Privacy  {-}

Your privacy is fragile, easy to lose instantaneously, and difficult to retrieve in an environment that requires so much online interaction.  

- [**Identity theft**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft){target="_blank"} happens, frequently.  
  - Never put your social security number, your birthday, your mother’s maiden name, or any other personal facts, anywhere online. Everyone on the Internet will be able to access this information.  
  - Always assume that anything you write online (including email) can, and probably will, eventually leak. Keep your email address private – to avoid receiving spam. If your email is published in a plain form anywhere online, even if it is part of an archived email list, spammers will “harvest” it for their databases.  
- **Spam email [(at least half of all email being sent)](https://securelist.com/spam-report-2019/96527/){target="_blank"}** – is an unfortunate fact of our modern lives.  
  - If you must publish your email address online, consider creating a “sacrificial” email address, or one you only use to publish online. You can create an email “alias,” which you can set to automatically forward to your primary email, and easily disable if your spam volumes increases.  
  - Another approach is to avoid publishing the email address as something like *myname@somewebdomain.net*... Instead you might use more confusing text, such as myname-at-somewebdomain-net. Some websites support using these types of obfuscation methods, but the spammers who "scrape" email addresses from websites to populate their spam databases use increasingly sophisticated methods to defeat these methods.  
  - Basically, avoid publishing the email addresses you value online to decrease the amount of spam you receive.  

#### Passwords {-}

What about passwords? Many people have just one, or maybe a few. Given the number of websites and web services which require password-based authentication, this is not good enough to avoid an identity disaster.

The problem with having only a few passwords is that even resource-rich and security-critical organizations have [suffered massive leaks](https://gizmodo.com.au/2017/05/over-560-million-passwords-discovered-in-anonymous-online-database/){target="_blank"}. If even one of them suffers a data leak, identity thieves will obtain your password and try to use it on other websites. It is easy for them to do this using computer technologies.

Other ways someone can get your password include:

- Sniffing traffic when you log into a non-secure website that uses http:// rather than https:// – the “s” stands for secure because your data transmission’s encrypted. Look for the Lock icon.png in your address bar.  
- Sniffing emails – your email, unless encrypted, is not secure. Never send a login and password along with the web address of a service (similarly, don’t send credit card numbers).  
- [Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing){target="_blank"} attacks – where someone sends you an email that looks like it is from a trusted sender, such as from a friend, your bank, an online store you frequent, or a government agency, and they ask you to enter your password to confirm it. No one should ever ask you to enter your password via email.  
- Always check the web address (hover over the link) to make sure it corresponds to the right place, or call the sender to confirm the request over the phone.  
- Brute force – hackers often use computers to guess your password, beginning with a list of [common passwords](https://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords){target="_blank"}, and try different combinations until they get it right, or until the system locks them out for trying too many times.  
- “How secure is my password” sites – you should avoid these sites and never type your password into a website or email response that is not appropriate, especially when you know the sender also knows your email.  
- Once your email and any password combination are known, identity thieves will try to use them at various websites, because they know most people only use a few passwords. A thief who discovers a password you created for a website you rarely use will try to compromise the security of a website that is important to you – such as your email system, your workplace, social media accounts, or bank account.  

There are services you can use to check if your email is part of a leaked password data set. So, what can you do to protect yourself?

**Password Managers**

Get a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager){target="_blank"}. They are incredibly helpful and convenient now that many of us use several computers and mobile devices. Password managers help you manage your passwords.  

- When you choose a password manager, make sure you create one [strong password](https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/){target="_blank"}, such as a full sentence with some numbers and special characters. This is all you need to remember – the password manager remembers the others. The ensures you generate a different, fully-random password for each website you use that requires a password.  
- Good password managers only ever store your details in an encrypted form, where even the company that stores it cannot see your passwords. To access your passwords, you log into the password manager service using your single, strong password (via a secure web link – usually the default, but always check!).  
- There are many [password manager options](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=password+managers&bshm=rimc/1){target="_blank"}. Some widely used proprietary options include [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/){target="_blank"} and [1password](https://1password.com/){target="_blank"}. Open source options also exist, such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/){target="_blank"}. Sadly, some of the most popular password managers have suffered from software bugs that have exposed user passwords.

### Activity: Get a Password Manager {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

If you don’t already use a password manager, set up an account with [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/){target="_blank"}, [1password](https://1password.com/){target="_blank"}, or the free password manager, [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/){target="_blank"} to familiarize yourself with how password managers work.

1. Read the instructions in the article: "[*How to Start Using a Password Manager*](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-start-using-password-manager/){target="_blank"}" published by Makeuseof.com  
1. Create an account on the password manager site and establish a Master Password. (Conduct an online search for advice on choosing a secure Master Password.)  
1. Install the browser extension for your local browser.  
1. Choose one of the TWU course websites and set up a new secure password using your password manager.  
1. Log out of the TWU course website, and log in again using the password manager.  
1. Install the mobile phone app for your operating system, and/or desktop application for your computer (optional). Synchronize the local app with your online vault.  
1. Consider using the Password manager for your online accounts so you can easily set up and maintain a unique password for each online account you use.  

```

#### Good Messaging Hygiene  {-}

Always assume that anyone can and will read anything you write in an email. Email is not a secure form of communication. Few people encrypt their email, because it is an extra step that even the most technically-inclined users are reluctant to take. Both sender and recipient have to be technically proficient.  

Text messages and instant messaging, such as Facebook messenger, are also insecure. Anyone, including government officials and the organization that runs the service, such as Facebook employees, can read it.  

**Secure your Own Privacy**  

Never send any sensitive data, such as your social security number, credit card number, password, or other personal information via email or text. Call the person to provide this information over the phone.  

You can use a secure, encrypted, text message service, such as Signal if necessary. It is available at no cost, works on most platforms, and encrypts text messages on your phone. If you text someone else with Signal installed, the entire transaction is encrypted.  

**Secure the Privacy of Others** 

Another element of good digital hygiene is to protect the identity of others. For example, never send group emails using To: or CC: (carbon copy) for each email address. You will reveal the email addresses for everyone on your list. This is especially problematic if you or another person saves the email message and displays it on the web, such as in a mailing list archive. This makes it easy for spammers and hackers to access and download all of those email addresses.  

Use BCC: (blind carbon copy), to hide the email addresses from your recipients, to protect everyone’s privacy. Use your own email address, and BCC the rest of the recipients, if your email software requires you to insert an email address into the To: box.  

When using an email mailing list, where you send messages to a single email address to a list of people, never CC: someone else in the same message. This will compromise the privacy of every CC’d recipient and the privacy of the list. Always check with the people on the list to ensure you are not taking unacceptable liberties.  

If someone asks you to share an email address of a friend or colleague, you should ask permission to share their email address, and state why the third party is requesting their email.  

**Be a Thoughtful Sceptic**  

So how can we protect ourselves if new threats are emerging all the time?  

- Be conscious of where you put information that is “private” to you.  
- Beware of the terms of service of social media providers, such as Facebook. Use a service like “[TOSDR](https://tosdr.org/){target="_blank"}" to help identify risky, overreaching services. You may be able to use certain privacy settings to protect your information.  
- Always check the identity of a website before you enter any passwords or personal information. Secure certificates are generally trustworthy, but be sure check the names and details.  
- Always ask whether you should trust a provider or a government agency. Always ask “who benefits when I do this?” What are their incentives?  
- Protect your own data and be even more protective of others’ private information. For example, be cautious before posting information about yourself or someone else. Be especially cautious when posting pictures or videos of their children.  
- Remember, complacency and unwarranted trust are your biggest enemies. A healthy paranoia is good for your digital health. Think about the great amount of time and effort it will take to regain your identity (and credit rating) if your information is compromised.

# Building Your Online Presence

## Overview {-}

Welcome to Unit 4!  In previous units, you've been introduced to the world of digital literacies and how to use various tools for organizing and connecting ideas. You have started to build a workflow to help you learn more effectively, and have applied the critical skill of metacognition to explain your process for learning. 

Now, let's delve into the next phase of our learning journey.

In the second half of the course, you will continue to build your digital skills and apply critical thinking to document your learning process. Our focus will shift from creating a personal collection of ideas to presenting your learning in a more open platform. It's important to emphasize that *you* will decide how public you want to be. We'll also consider why sharing knowledge is important and explore user-friendly ways to do so while still maintaining your control over your work and handling privacy matters. As you begin this unit, reflect on your personal and academic goals as they relate to digital literacy. Consider which digital tools you'd like to explore and reflect on how your online contributions can not only benefit you, but also make a positive impact on others.

### Topics {-}

This unit is divided into the following topics:


1. Personal Learning Environments  
2. Building a Learning Blog  
3. My Digital Footprint  
4. Evaluating Digital Tools  

<!--

- Remember, your fellow students are a valuable resource! Engage with your online community for assistance, and don't hesitate to exchange helpful resources and valuable insights.  
```



## Personal Learning Environments 

The primary purpose of this topic is to enable you to set up your own Learning Blog, which will form the hub of your Personal Learning Environment (PLE). Blog posts are a useful way of reflecting on your learning and a means to network with your peers. It also provides our TWU learning community with a way to see how you are engaging with the course and to help where we can. The purpose of a PLE is to put the learner at the centre of the online learning environment, which will be enabled by establishing a personal blog for this course. 

**So what is a Personal Learning Environment?**

> 'Personal Learning Environments are systems that help learners take control of and manage their own learning. This includes providing support for learners to set their own learning goals, manage their learning; managing both content and process, communicate with others in the process of learning, and thereby achieve learning goals. A PLE may be composed of one or more sub-systems: As such it may be a desktop application, or composed of one or more web-based services.' [PLE Wiki](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Personal_learning_environment){target="_blank"}

> A Personal Learning Environment is "a structure and process that helps learners organize the influx of information, resources and interactions that they are faced with on a daily basis into a personalized learning space or experience. In a PLE, the learner develops an individualized digital identity through the perceptual cues and cognitive affordances that the personal learning environment provides, such as what information to share and when, who to share it with, and how to effectively merge formal and informal learning experiences ([Castañeda, Cosgrave, Marín, Cronin, 2016](https://naerjournal.ua.es/article/view/v6n1-introduction#){target="_blank"}) cited in [Personal Learning Environments: Research-Based Practices, Frameworks and Challenges](https://naerjournal.ua.es/article/view/v6n1-introduction){target="_blank"}.

What elements of the two definitions resonate with you?  How do you organize your daily interations and influx of information? How do you share your learning with others? What are your learning goals? 


### Activity: What is a PLE? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Before you start building your PLE, read the following article:  

- [“*7 Things you should know about personal learning environments*"](assets/u4/U4_7-things-you-should-know-about-PLNs.pdf){target="_blank"}


<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider</span>

After reading the article, consider the following:

- How do PLEs promote authentic, student-centred learning?  
- What are the benefits of a PLE?  How would it benefit you?  
- What tools do you currently use as part of your learning environment?  

Finally, consider the approach taken at TWU as it supports inquiry-rich learning.  As you watch the short video below, think about how you could use your PLE to enrich your learning at TWU.

[Watch: *Inquiry-Rich Learning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCa9Nt3X1vU){target="_blank”}

</div>

```

## Building a Learning Blog

In the next activity, you will gain first hand experience in using blog technology for publishing your own website. You will “declare” yourself online using your PLE (as an alternative to posting an introduction in a closed course forum typically used in a conventional online course). Note that TWU online courses often use Moodle Discussion Forums to facilitate conversations.  By using a platform such as Wordpress, you can retain the contents of your posts, as well as the comments of your peers.  In an LMS (Learning Management System) such as Moodle, you may lose access to what you have posted in discussions, and more importantly, conversations with your peers.  As you create your personal blog in WordPress (or your own selective blog site), you control your data and who can see it.

You will retain control of your data and learning outputs generated during this online course, even after the course is completed.
You get to choose:

- The blog service you would like to use, although **we recommend WordPress as it is supported by TWU**.  
- Whether to accept comments on your blog from your peers  
- Whether to register your blog for the aggregated course feed so that any posts tagged with the course code (LDRS101) will be harvested for the feed.  

A key teaching philosophy of this course is to embed the acquisition of new digital literacies into your learning journey. Knowledge of how to use the Internet and social media technologies will better prepare you for life in a digital world. If this is your first time blogging, you should spend time in setting up your personal digital learning environment. Please remember that your Learning Blog and the social media technologies you use on this course are public, and that you take full responsibility for anything you publish. Do not disclose any confidential information and respect the privacy of others. In short, don’t say anything that you would not want to read on the Internet.


### Activity: Setting Up Your Learning Blog {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

As this is a course focusing on digital literacies, you are asked to establish a Learning Blog, as this will improve your skills and enable you to network with your peers. We recommend using WordPress, as it is supported by TWU. WordPress is an open source website builder and is one of the most popular systems out there because of its versatility. If you already have your own website or you have previous experience using WordPress, you may set up your blog on it and skip the set-up steps described below, but you still need to complete the learning activities.

<!--

need to modify video

Watch the following video tutorial on how to create a website using WordPress. This video provides you with an overview of all the necessary steps. Do not worry if you start to feel overwhelmed — we will break these steps down for you one by one in the learning activities in this course.


<div class ="video-container">

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/f45737c6-fc7b-4c6e-a13f-f656c808ea06?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; height: 100%; max-width: 100%;"></iframe>


</div>

-->


> We are here to help you create your site, so do not hesitate to ask for technical support. Below you will find a number of resources, but if you get stuck, please reach out on Discourse, or email elearning@twu.ca

To get started on creating your site we suggest the following steps:

<details>
<summary>**1. Sign up to create a website**</summary>

Go to **[create.twu.ca](https://create.twu.ca/){target="_blank"}** to sign up for your free WordPress site. *Please read all the prompts and instructions carefully!*
Be sure to read the Privacy Statement carefully before clicking “I Agree.” The information provided gives you excellent guidance regarding digital citizenship, privacy, and how to build a professional digital persona.

You will be prompted to **create a domain name**, which is your website’s address on the Internet. Often this is referred to as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). This is what your users will type in their browsers to reach your site. Make sure that you choose a domain name that is related to you, easy to pronounce and spell, and easy to remember. Once you have done that, we suggest you write all this information somewhere you can access it easily – just in case. 

You will also be asked to **select a theme** for your website. You are free to choose any template you wish. TWU Spark, TWU Hope, and TWU Spartans portfolio are simple to set up and provide easy navigation.

When you choose your theme, your new site will come with a simple menu and instructions for portfolio and website creation. 

When you have activated your site (look for a notification in your TWU email), then you are ready to create.  

 </details>

<details>
<summary>**2. Explore your dashboard**</summary>

The dashboard is the initial area you see when you log in to TWU Create. It’s the centre for your site management and where you create content. From the Dashboard you can navigate to content, settings, themes, plugins, and more.

When logged in to TWU Create, you will always have access to an **admin menu** visible on your sites. From the menu item that is the name of the blog (second from left), you can find the link to the dashboard. While in the dashboard, the same menu can be used to return to the front view of your site.

Determine the difference between the dashboard used for editing and the published view of your blog. (It is important to know the difference because, when you register your blog for the course feed, you must use the url for the public view of your blog).  
*Progress check:*  
- Do you know how to open the published (public view) of your blog in a new window?  
- Have you added a browser bookmark to your dashboard and public version of your blog?  

**Help Tips:** When you are in the site administration area of your site, you can get tips on what you are doing by clicking the “Help” menu on the top-right corner. Click on "Help" and read through the Overview describing the elements of the dashboard.

insert - Animation showing location of WordPress help tab - from [https://create.twu.ca/eportfolios/wordpress/](https://create.twu.ca/eportfolios/wordpress/){target="_blank"} 

 </details>


<details>
<summary>**3. Review your settings**</summary>

Review and customise your blog settings from the dashboard according to your preferences. 

-   
**Enable Categories and Tags**
We recommend that you enable **categories** and **tags** on your blog.  
**Categories** are best used for broad groupings of topics. For example, if you’re creating a site that reviews pop culture, you might use categories such as Books, Film, and TV.

**Tags** are more specific keywords that you want to use to associate related content. For example, if you were creating a site that reviews pop culture, you might want to use tags such as science fiction, horror, and action adventure.

You can combine the two! For our review site example, you might be reviewing a romantic comedy. You can assign the broader category Film to the post, then give it some more specific tags such as romantic comedy, or even use the name of the actors and director as tags. People who view that post could use the tags to find related posts around that topic.

**Set up Comments Settings (Optional)**  
WordPress comes with a built-in comment system allowing your users to leave comments on your posts. This comment system is great for user engagement, but it can also be targeted by spammers as well. If you don't want comments on your posts, then ensure that the 'Allow comments' box is unchecked at the bottom of the editor page.  

If you do want comments, but want to manage the spam, you’ll need to enable comment moderation on your website.

Visit Settings » Discussions page and scroll down to ‘Before a comment appears’ section. Check the box next to ‘Comment must be manually approved’ option.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**4. Personalise your blog**</summary>  
Visit the appearance option on your dashboard and personalise your blog by:   
- Changing your theme, header image, background colours and/or image  
- Add at least one widget to your blog.  Remember —  “less is more“. One or two of the following are functional choices: Archives, recent posts, categories or category cloud, and blogs I follow.  

You need to hit the **“Save”** button to save your changes.

 </details>

<details>
<summary>**5. Add a page & a post**</summary>

Pages and posts are where the content is housed on WordPress. The biggest difference between the two is that posts are timestamped, whereas pages are timeless.

**Pages** are for static content. They do not need a publish date. Use pages you want your visitors to always be able to see that content in that spot, no matter when they visit.

**Posts** are for timely content. They have a publish date, and they are displayed with the newest content at the top (reverse chronological order) of your site’s blog page. Older posts can “fall off” the blog page (the content is still kept, but no longer visible). Posts are what you should think of when you hear the term “blog post.” Usually posts have a comment section, and this is where viewers can write a comment in response to your post. This may be a handy way to receive feedback from your peers. Also, you can categorize or tag your posts, which is useful to help readers locate posts on your blog.


To add a new Page or Post, click the Pages or Posts menu option and then click the Add New link underneath.  Another way is to hover your cursor over Pages or Posts and click the Add new link in the fly-out menu.

***BLOG CHALLENGE!***  

**Edit a Page:** Complete your personal details for display on the “About” page of your blog.  
- *Progress check:* Can you see the updates on your “about” page in the published view of your blog?


**Edit a Blog Post:**  Reflect on your experience of this activity on creating a blog.
Click on “save draft” (so you can review before publishing live on the web). Your reflection could for example:  
- Introduce yourself and reflect on what you would like to achieve by maintaining a blog to support your learning  
- Reflect on what you thought of the activity; Was it easy or hard?  
- Share links to any additional resources you found useful in completing the tasks.  
- Provide tips for future learners who will be completing this activity. If you were to set up a new blog again, what would you do differently?  
- Add anything your readers may find interesting or useful.  

 </details>

<details>
<summary>**6. Add media**</summary>

Using different types of media to represent your artifacts is a great way to make your portfolio dynamic and keep your audience engaged. Text-heavy pages can get cumbersome regardless of how you arrange it. Media can help with breaking up content or replacing text all together. Consider how you can “show what you know” rather than just simply telling. Media can also be an alternative to simply hyperlinking all your artifacts. Instead of sending your audience off to another site or tab, media can be embedded (see [Media Library](https://create.twu.ca/eportfolios/wordpress/media-library/){target="_blank"}) to keep your audience contained to your page.

The Media Library on your WordPress site houses the media you upload to your site. WordPress supports a variety of media types such as images, audio, video, and documents. We do suggest that you host your video files in your TWU Microsoft Stream account for optimal playability. Other types of media are typically uploaded and inserted into the text editor when writing a post or page.

***BLOG PHOTO CHALLENGE!***

**Choose a photo** to add to your blog post.   
- Be sure you have permission to upload the photo.  We suggest using an open licence site, such as [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/){target="_blank"}, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/){target="_blank"}, [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/){target="_blank"}, [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page){target="_blank"}, or [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=pho&license=2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C9){target="_blank"}.  
- Alternatively, upload your own photo, take a selfie or ask someone to take a photo of you working on this blog post challenge.

***BLOG VIDEO CHALLENGE!*** (Optional)

You may find as you continue the course that you want to share videos you find on the web, or perhaps even your own!  

If you're up for the challenge, consider recording a short video introduction and embed this in your blog post.

Here is a tutorial on how to add a Youtube video or embed one of your own videos to your blog:

</div>

 </details>

<details>
<summary>**7. Publish!**</summary>

Review your draft post and, when you’re happy with what you’ve written, click on the **“Publish post”** button.

 </details>

<details>
<summary>**7. Share your blog**</summary>

Add a **category** or **tag** for your post using the course tag: LDRS101

Post in the **LDRS 101 Discourse forum** to let your peers know the web address of your blog and ask them to post a comment. This will give you the opportunity to experience how comments function on your blog and to test if they are working properly.

Congratulations!!  You created your PLE for TWU!


## My Digital Footprint 

Now that you have created your Learning Blog and introduced yourself online, let's take a closer look at the information about you available on the internet. Imagine if potential employers were to search for you online. What would they discover, and what would you prefer them to find? As we examine online identities in this topic, we will ask you to consider how you can improve your digital identity in support of your online learning, as well as future employment prospects.

First, let's clarify some key terms.

We need to distinguish between the technical and human elements of online identity. In this course, we are more interested in the human side of online identity, but in part, this is determined by how technology automates the process of building your digital footprint.

>**Digital identity** refers to the information utilized by computer systems to represent external entities, including a person, organization, application, or device. When used to describe an individual, it encompasses a person's compiled information and plays a crucial role in automating access to computer-based services, verifying identity online, and enabling computers to mediate relationships between entities. Digital identity for individuals is an aspect of a person's social identity and can also be referred to as online identity. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity){target="_blank"}: Online).

>**Digital footprint** or digital shadow refers to one's unique set of traceable digital activities, actions, contributions, and communications manifested on the Internet or digital devices. Digital footprints can be classified as either passive or active. The former is composed of a user's web-browsing activity and information stored as cookies. The latter is often released deliberately by a user to share information on websites or social media. While the term usually applies to a person, a digital footprint can also refer to a business, organization or corporation. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_footprint){target="_blank"}:Online).


### Activity: What is a Digital Footprint? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Watch the following video and consider the steps you would take to control your digital footprint.

<div class ="video-container">

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dmQGq_FNBpE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

</div>

```

### Activity: Who am I Online...and Why Should I Care? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Read the following articles:

- [Understanding your Online Identity](assets/u4/U4_Understanding-your-Online-Identity-An-Overview-of-Identity.pdf){target="_blank"}.
- [How To Manage Your Digital Footprint: 20 Tips for Students](https://research.com/education/how-to-manage-digital-footprint){target="_blank"}

<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider</span>

Consider the following questions:

- How does your real-world identity differ from your online identity?  
- What factors inhibit or support the sharing of information in building an online identity?  
- What is the value of an online identity for learning?  

> Reminder: As you view online resources in this course, feel free to annotate and discuss web resources publicly in support of your learning. (Digital Tools: Hypothes.is, Discourse, WordPress, etc.)

In addition to evaluating who you are online, ask yourself, "Why Should I Care?"

### Activity: Digital Footprint Audit {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity you will audit your own digital footprint in order to find out what exists on the internet about you, and reflect on what you want your online identity to be.  Follow the steps below to begin.

1. Conduct a Google search of your own name (using an incognito or private window in Chrome or Firefox). Search for your first name and surname without parenthesis (for example: snow white) and then with parenthesis (for example: “snow white”). Explore the results of your search.  
1. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of current and previous employers.  
1. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of previous schools you attended.  
1. Expand your search to include social media sites, for example: “snow white” twitter; “snow white” facebook; “snow white” youtube etc.  
1. Note any interesting or surprising findings.  

```

### Activity: Blog: My Digital Footprint {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Prepare and publish a short blog post of about 250 to 300 words focusing on what you hope to achieve with your online digital identity for learning. Your post can include:

1. **Reflection**: Share your thoughts on the outcomes of your footprint audit. Remember that your blog post is public, so only share what you are comfortable sharing with the world. You don’t need to be specific; for example, you can generalise: "I am satisfied with my digital footprint because ..." or "I would like to improve my digital footprint for learning because ..."  
1. **Professional versus private**: Consider how you want to separate your “private” online identity from your professional and / or learning identity. If you already maintain an online presence (existing blog or social media accounts) think about how you will separate professional / learning posts from private and social life interactions online. For example, maintaining a separate course or learning blog is one way to achieve this distinction. Will you link your personal online identities (e.g. an existing X (formerly Twitter) username or Facebook account) with your learning blog? Will you link your professional online identity (e.g. published online biography or resume) with your learning blog?  
1. **Objectives**: List a few objectives for developing or improving your online identity.  
1. **Tag**: Add a category or tag to your post using the course tag: LDRS101 (This is needed to harvest links to posts from registered blogs for the course feed.)  

**Remember**: You are in charge of what you post online and you decide what you would like to share for your digital identity for the purposes of this course. Don’t share high risk personal details like physical address, date of birth, name of first pet, etc., which may make it easier for identity thieves to appear more credible. If unsure, consult online resources for internet safety; for example [Get Cyber Safe](https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-accounts/social-media){target="_blank"} from the government of Canada.

## Evaluating Online Tools

So far in Unit 4, you have created a Learning Blog in WordPress, explored your social media platforms, and used a range of other tools like Zotero, Hypothes.is, Discourse, Obsidian, and more. 

As we step into this new topic, we encourage you to engage in a critical examination of the online tools you use or are interested in. Beyond the basic considerations of functionality and user-friendliness, we invite you to assess digital tools, platforms, and interactions through the lens of ethical principles.

So how do we evaluate technology on ethical principles?  Here are some guiding questions from [Ethical EdTech](https://ethicaledtech.info/wiki/Meta:About){target="_blank"}:

>**Guiding Questions**  
>  
>- Where does power lie, and where are we expected to place our trust?  
>- To whom is it accessible—for instance, in terms of usability and cost?  
>- Does it lock us into closed, commercial systems or invite us into open communities?  
>- Does it give us more control over the learning process, or does it cede that control?  
>- Does it respect and protect our privacy appropriately?  
>- Can we access, study, and modify the underlying code or design?  
>- Who owns the infrastructure and our usage data? Does it produce private profit or public commons?  

These crucial questions highlight the importance of privacy, data ownership, and accessibility.  What other questions would you ask to ensure a tech tool is ethical? 

### Activity: What Are My Criteria?  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Read the following [Rubric for Digital Tool Evaluation](assets/u4/U4_Rubric-for-Digital-Tool-Evaluation.pdf).  Note there are a number of criteria, some that may not apply to the tool you choose to evaluate.  In this activity, create your own criteria for evaluating digital tools.  Set up a spreadsheet or notepad (in Obsidian for example) and as you list your criteria, consider why that detail is important to you.

To help you select your criteria, read the following:

- [Privacy policy](https://www.internetsociety.org/policybriefs/privacy/){target="_blank"} from the Internet Society  
- [Ethical EdTech](https://ethicaledtech.info/wiki/Meta:About){target="_blank"}  

This next website might be a bit of an eye-opener.  You may want to browse through some common tech examples and see their score.  

- [Terms of service. Didn’t read](https://tosdr.org/){target="_blank"}  

Finally, read the following questions and consider what you want to add to your rubric considering the context of the tool, the terms of service, and the purpose.

<details>
<summary>**Business Context**</summary>
  
- Who owns the tool?  
- Who is the tool maker or CEO?  
- What are their politics? Does that matter?  
- What is the tool’s history?  
- How do they market themselves?  
- How does the company generate revenue?  
- What is their market positioning / point of difference?  
- Who are the competitors?  
- What do others say about the product? Are these sources reliable?  

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Terms of Service**</summary>

- What are the terms of service? Are they easy to find?  
- What personal data is required to use the tool (username, real names, email, date of birth etc)?  
- Who owns the data?  
- How is the data protected?  
- Where is the data housed?  
- What flexibility do users have to be anonymous?  
- Does the tool support open licensing of user generated content?  
- How is copyright infringement managed?  
- How is user generated content distributed by the company? What license does the user give the company for distributing to third parties?  
- Can users delete their accounts or leave the service?  
- Can users export their data? What export formats are supported?  
- How is personal information managed?  
- Can information be shared with third parties, and if so under what conditions?  
- Can the company terminate a users account? Under what conditions?  
- How are the changes to the terms of service managed?  

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Fit For Purpose**</summary>
  
- Is the tool suitable for the stated purpose?  
- How does the design of the tool influence what users can do with the tool?  
- Does the tool provide support resources and or help tutorials?  
- Search the web to find out if others provide help and advice on using the tool (for example Youtube, blog posts etc.)  
- What are the implications or opportunities of the tool to support learning in a digital age?  

</details>

```

## Digital Citizenship

Before attempting to define *digital citizenship*, let's consider the concept of citizenship in its own right. In its simplest form, citizenship refers to the rights, privileges and duties of being a national citizen. However, the concept of being a good citizen encompasses much more, particularly if you think about full engagement as a member of society.  

>*“Citizenship is a status that is bestowed on those who are full members of a community.”*  
>
>**-—T.H. Marshall**

### Activity: Reflecting on Digital Citizenship {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}


If good citizenship means to fulfill your role as citizen, can you think of five things good citizens do? Consider the following questions:

- In a digital world, is loyalty to your country a necessary component of the definition of good citizenship?  
- Is education a pre-requisite for good citizenship?  
- In a digital world, what does it mean to be a global citizen? Read the Wikipedia article on [Global Citizenship Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_citizenship_education){target="_blank"} where learners engage in solving real world problems.  
-  Has the concept of good citizenship changed over time? In what ways?  
- Does citizenship require active community engagement? Read this post by Kristen Mattson, director of a high school library media center: [John Dewey Would Hate Your Digital Citizenship Curriculum](https://drkmattson.wordpress.com/2016/08/03/john-dewey-would-hate-your-digital-citizenship-curriculum/){target="_blank"}.  
- Why has the concept *digital* been linked with *citizenship* or should we drop the word *digital* and just talk about *good citizenship*?  

Write your thoughts in your Reflective Journal (using Obsidian or WordPress).

Conclude by writing down a description of “digital citizenship” in your own words. (You will need this later for the assessment. It does not need to be a scholarly definition – just your personal thoughts on the concept.)

```

### Defining Digital Citizenship {-}

Defining digital citizenship is not easy because it means different things to different people. It is also a concept which is debated among scholars researching the field.  

If you conduct a general search for “digital citizenship” you will find many links referencing resources targeting the school-level, with a focus on safe, skilled and ethical use of online technology. While these aspects are important, for the purposes of this tertiary-level course, we need to explore the concept of digital citizenship in more detail.  


### Activity: Podcast on Digital Citizenship {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity you will listen to a podcast that focuses on the people dimension of digital citizenship.

Meet [Autumm Caines](http://autummcaines.com/){target="_blank"}, associate director of academic technology from the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching at Capital University in a podcast with Bonni Stachowiak.

Listen to the first 15–20 minutes of this Teaching in HigherEd podcast on Digital citizenship. The podcast introduces aspects of digital citizenship and the learner experience in starting out with engagement with social media.

[Listen: *Digital Citizenship - with Autumm Caines*](https://teachinginhighered.com/115){target="_blank"}

```

### Guiding framework {-}

Autumm Caines provides a useful framework for thinking about digital citizenship

1. *Digital identities* that is who you are online including the identities of others (individuals and organisations).  
1. *Digital environments*, specifically the tools and online spaces we use to interact with each other. (For example Facebook, Discourse, X, Blogs, Forums etc.).  
1. *Interactions* between these identities and environments.  

![The model for digital citizenship from the work of Autumm Cainnes](assets/u5/Digital_citizenship_Venn.png)



### Activity: Refined Definition of Digital Citizenship {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

The purpose of this activity is to explore the elements of digital citizenship with particular emphasis on those relevant to your academic study.  

Read through the following resources in order to refine your own definition of what it means to be a Digital Citizen.

**Step 1: Online Search:**  

- Read the introductory section of the Wikipedia article: [Digital citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_citizen){target="_blank"}  
- Conduct a general search for “definition of digital citizen.” Choose the two best definitions and add these to the library of your citation management tool (Hypothes.is / Zotero / Obsidian), or keep a record for citation purposes.  
- Try and locate one recent scholarly definition for “digital citizen.” Record the reference for citation purposes. How recent is the reference?  

**Step 2: Social Media Search:** 

- Explore the recent tweets (on X or whichever social media app you prefer) using the following hashtags: #digitalcitizenship, #digiciz, and #digicit.  Compile a list of elements relating to the concept of digital citizenship.  

**Step 3: Read & Comment:** 
- Login to hypothes.is.  
- Read [Nine elements of digital citizenship](https://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html){target="_blank"} by Mike Ribble  
- Feel free to add or reply to annotations using Hypothes.is. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: #LDRS101 (This is needed to harvest posts for the course feed.)  


**Step 4: Apply the Elements** 
Generate a table listing the nine elements of digital citizenship and identify a practical example of the element for your academic study: For example:  

| **Element**  | **Academic Study Example**               |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Digital access     | Students from low income countries may not have reliable or affordable access to the Internet.                 |
| Digital commerce  |  |
| Digital communication     |               |
| Digital literacy     |                  |
| Digital etiquette  |  |
| Digital law      |              |
| Digital rights and responsibilities     |                  |
| Digital health and wellness |  |
| Digital security       |               |
	  
  
**Step 5: Define Digital Citizenship**
After completing the steps above, revise your personal description of digital citizenship. Does your new definition differ from your initial description?  

**Step 6: Share Your Insights!**
Share a reflection on this activiy by posting either in your blog or on the Discourse forum.

For example:

- I didn’t realize the ... is part of digital citizenship because ...  
- ... is not particularly relevant for university learners because ...  
- ... is particularly relevant for university learners because ...  

```



### Rights and Responsibilities {-}

The concept of citizenship encompasses the rights and responsibilities of individuals. We need to consider what rights and responsibilities come with digital citizenship. In this mini challenge, we explore this topic with particular emphasis on the rights and responsibilities associated with learning in a digital age.

Following the hype of massive open online courses (MOOC) and the New York Times declaring 2012 the “[year of the MOOC](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html){target="_blank"},“ a small group of educators drafted “A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in a Digital Age.” This document forms the basis for a course discussion on the rights and responsibilities of digital citizens.



### Activity: Rights & Responsibilities of Digital Citizens {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

1. **Search:** Conduct a general search for rights and responsibilities of digital citizenship to assist in refining your own list for university online study. Your search is likely to generate many results developed for the school sector, so you need to evaluate if these rights and responsibilities are appropriate for you.  

- Udacity version of the bill of rights: [A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in the Digital Age](https://www.udacity.com/blog/2013/01/a-bill-of-rights-and-principles-for.html){target="_blank"}
- [‘Bill of Rights’ Seeks to Protect Students’ Interests as Online Learning Rapidly Expands](https://www.chronicle.com/article/bill-of-rights-seeks-to-protect-students-interests-as-online-learning-rapidly-expands/){target="_blank"}, from the Chronicle of Higher Education.  
- [Critique of ‘Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in the Digital Age’](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/law-policy-and-it/critique-bill-rights-and-principles-learning-digital-age){target="_blank"} from Inside Higher Ed.  

- Conduct a search through the TWU library for [Digital Rights and Responsibilities](https://twu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&bquery=digital+rights+and+responsibility&cli0=FT1&clv0=Y&type=0&searchMode=And&site=eds-live&scope=site){target="_blank"}

*Remember to annotate and comment on the Hypothes.is and tag your contributions using the course code: #LDRS101*

2. **Blog:** Prepare a table summarising the primary rights and responsibilities for university learning in a digital age.  

3. **Discuss:** Drawing on your knowledge and experience, please join the discussion on Discourse regarding rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age at TWU. You can discuss the topical issues listed below, or add new ones to the forum. In each case, justify your position taking opposing views into account.  

<span class="blockhead">Topical Issues</span>

- Should higher education institutions have the right to determine what software applications learners should use for their studies?  
- Data generated by learners belongs to the learners, therefore should they have the right to access their data (for example forum discussion contributions) even after the course has completed?   
- Should higher education institutions reserve the right to ban disruptive learners from their learning platforms?  
- Where legally permissible, should learners have the right to access all course materials without the need to register a password?  
- Should higher education institutions have the right to limit the time required for completing a course?  
- Others?  

We encourage you to reply and “like” good posts on Discourse. (Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS101).  

```



### Personal and Professional Identity {-}

In short, digital citizenship is about being a person on the web. In the previous unit on building your online presence, we noted that individuals portray different personas online, for example personal, academic and professional.

On the one hand, we need to be careful about what we post online because this can have a negative impact on future career prospects or current employment. We must also be cognisant of the different limitations that different careers place on what can be shared publicly and what needs to stay private. On the other hand, building a strong learning or professional network online is very powerful in staying up to date with new trends and establishing connections with your peers.

In this section, we reflect on the balance between public and private in a digital world, recognising that this is going to be different for each person depending on their own environments and professional circumstances. We will also explore how like-minded professionals in your field of interest network online.

> *“The impact exercised by ICTs is due to at least four major transformations: the blurring of the distinction between reality and virtuality; the blurring of the distinction between human, machine and nature; the reversal from information scarcity to information abundance; and the shift from the primacy of stand-alone things, properties, and binary relations, to the primacy of interactions, processes and networks."*
> 
>***—- Luciano Floridi***

### Activity: Professional Online Identity and Digital Citizenship {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity we will explore professional online identity and networking in the field of your choice.  

First, scan a few of the following resources:

- [High court rules public servants can be sacked for political social media posts](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/07/high-court-rules-public-servants-can-be-sacked-for-political-social-media-posts){target="_blank"}, published by The Guardian.  
- [‘Think of social media as a virtual resumé](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/experts-surprised-by-what-people-will-say-on-social-media-1.4176138){target="_blank"},’ expert warns in light of health board resignation, published by CBC News.  
- You can also search online using the terms "fired over tweet" or "social media firing cases".


Next, watch this short video interview with Alec Couros, published by Teaching and Learning in South Australia. Alec summarises how educators are using twitter to connect professionally.

- How do like-minded professionals in your career or future career, field, discipline etc. network online (for example X, LinkEdIn groups, other websites?)? 
- What hashtags, if any, are being used for conversations in your chosen field? 
- What are the topical areas of discussion at the moment? 
- How could your field of interest improve professional networking online? 
- Do organisations in your field place restrictions on employees participating in social networks? (See for example [Corporate Social Media Policies: The Good, the Mediocre, and the Ugly](https://www.fastcompany.com/1668368/corporate-social-media-policies-good-mediocre-and-ugly){target="_blank"}, and [More Social Media Policies: LA Times, Harvard Law, Microsoft, and Cisco](https://www.fastcompany.com/1670530/more-social-media-policies-la-times-harvard-law-microsoft-and-cisco){target="_blank"}.) 

```

### Activity: Blog: Professional online identity and digital citizenship {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Prepare a short blog post (about 300 – 400 words) summarising your findings on professional online networking in your field of interest. Consider the following questions:

- How do like-minded professionals in your field network online and what do they talk about?  
- What does this mean for your online identity and being a digital citizen?  

Remember to add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LDRS101.

```

### Activity: Blog: My Online Biography {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this challenge you are asked to build or update your professional online biography and the “About” page of your course blog. 

1. Reflect on the following online personas, target audience and how this will impact on the style and voice of the communication medium.  

| **Persona**  | **Primary audience**               |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Personal     | Friends and family                 |
| Professional | (Future) Employers and professional network |
| Academic     | Peer learning network              |


2. Choose the most appropriate medium for each of your online personas, for example:    

| **Persona**  | **Medium example**                    |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Personal     | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/){target="_blank"} |
| Professional | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/){target="_blank"} |
| Academic     | Learning blog or website                |


3. Identify one or two professionals from your field of interest who maintain an active web presence and contribute regularly via social media. Explore their respective websites and professional listings as examples.   
- X (formerly Twitter) is a good place to search for individuals using popular hashtags from your field or area of study, for example “#highereducation”.    
- Click through to their respective X user page. If they have a personal website listed on the user page, visit the site and review their “About” page.  
- Visit their employer’s page and try to locate their biography on the employer’s website.  
- Search for the user on Linkedin  
- Compare the user information on these different sites. Observe how they link to social media accounts, and vary the style and content presented for the different personas.

4. Create or update your professional profile on Linkedin. 
- Consult TWU's [Student Resources website](Student Resources
) about LinkedIn.) TWU gives you access to LinkedIn Learning, which includes several great courses and videos, such as [Rock Your LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/rock-your-linkedin-profile/connect-to-opportunity-with-linkedin?u=124451074){target="_blank"}. 

5. Create or update your “About” page on your Learning Blog. You may prefer using a more informal style for this page aligned with your own personality and interests. Include links to your professional profile and respective links to social media that you use.

6. Visit the profile pages of your active social media accounts. Update if necessary providing links back to your main page (for example, the “About” page on your website).

7. Think carefully about information you post publicly and keep a clear distinction between your personal online presence and your professional online persona. Review your privacy settings on your personal account(s).

## Online Communities 

In this section we explore the topic of online communities and how we can engage in social media to enhance our learning.

In the early years of the internet, there was a strong research interest in studying the differences between virtual and real communities. However, in more recent years, we have observed a blurring of the boundaries between online and real communities. In [The difference between online & real life community?](https://quiip.com.au/is-there-a-definitive-difference-between-online-and-real-life-community/){target="_blank"} Alison Michalk states:

> Community boundaries are blurred to the extent that the Internet is nothing more than a conduit for communication. The Internet is now just another tool that we use to communicate within our various communities. The same as we use mail, telephone and even a car to keep in touch with our friends, family and colleagues. Our ‘real life communities’ are not mutually exclusive from our ‘online communities’ given that it all comes down to implied physical presence. (2013, June 27)

So how do we join and contribute constructively to these digital communities? If you don’t have much experience with online communities, we enccourage you to participate in the course forums and become an active member of the TWU online learning community.

### Research on Online Communities  {-} 
Research on the efficacy of online communities provides insights on selecting productive communities and how to engage. Community contributors can be classified into three types ([Mocus et al 2002](https://twu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edb&AN=100369742&site=eds-live&scope=site)):

1. *Core members* are responsible for guiding the development of the community and have usually been involved with the community for a long time. These members have made significant contributions to the community’s evolution and have earned leadership status. Frequently they also play an active role in moderation of the group.  
2. *Active members* make regular contributions to the community.  
3. *Peripheral members* occasionally contribute to the discussions and the periods of engagement are short and sporadic. “Lurkers”, that is individuals seeking answers without making contributions, are normally associated with this group.  
The nature of engagement in a community is influenced by the community’s life cycle stage ([A. Iriberri and G. Leroy 2009](https://twu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edscma&AN=edscma.1459356&site=eds-live&scope=site){target="_blank"}):

| **Life cycle stage**  | **Characteristics**                    |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Inception stage     | Focus is on determining the purpose, codes of conduct, funding and sustainability. |
| Creation stage | User-centred design and evolution including issues of privacy, anonymity, open versus closed communications. |
| Growth stage     | Focus is on community building, for example: recruiting members, growth management, integrating new members, trust building, up-to-date content, interaction support, a few offline and online events and meetings.               |
| Maturity stage     | By this stage a community culture will have emerged with identifiable community leaders. Focus shifts to permeated management and control, recognition of contributions, recognition of loyalty, member satisfaction management and subgroup management.                |

Additional factors identified by the research to keep in mind include:

- *Network cohesion*, that is the overall level of connections indicated by the network density has a positive impact on the core group as well as the success of the community ([Toral et al 2010](https://twu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edselp&AN=S0950584909001888&site=eds-live&scope=site){target="_blank"}).  
- *Network structure*. Successful communities need a critical mass of contributors, however there is no fixed number that determines success. Most communities can expect between 45 – 90% of non-active members, but communities with a strong and experienced core group will have a positive impact on success (Toral et al 2010[3]). Moreover, the positive effects of network structure on participation persist irrespective of the life cycle stage of the community, and activity participation influences network structure (Igl 2014[4]).  
- *Centralization*. Communities with a high degree of centralisation and control exerts a negative impact on all participation variables. ([Igl 2014](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/node?id=1218984){target="_blank"}).  

**Practical implications**

There are many online communities, and it will be worth your effort in doing a little online research to determine the network cohesion and network structure of the community. You will be able to determine this by reviewing the archive history. Avoid communities with overly centralised control, in the long run, they are not likely to be productive.

When joining an online community, try to identify the life cycle stage by scanning the archive of posts. Young communities are likely to be more tolerant of newbie questions, as responses to these questions will provide support resources for new members in the future. It’s a good idea to search the forum for your answer before posting a question. Don’t be surprised if newbie questions go answered in mature communities, they may can even attract curt rebuttals. If you’re a long standing member of the community, post a tactful reply, for example, “Your question has already been answered” and post a link to the appropriate reply.

The best advice when joining a new community is to lurk for a while before introducing yourself so that you can become familiar with the culture and practices of the community. Fill out your profile page on the forum site, rather than posting a biography in the main discussion threads. Of course, if the community is in the creation phase, you may want to play a more active role in building the community and becoming part of the core contributors.

### Communities of Practice {-}

As you continue to reflect on your social network and consider other learning networks to join for personal or professional growth, we want to present another framing of an online community called a ***Community of Practice***. 

> A community of practice (CoP) is a group of people who *"share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly"*.
> 
> ***-- Wenger, 2014*** 

Cognitive anthropologists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger coined the term “community of practice” when studying apprenticeships as a learning model—the term referred to the community that acts as a living curriculum. Once the concept was articulated the researchers started to see communities everywhere, even when no formal apprenticeship system existed.

The basic premise behind communities of practice is simple: we all learn in everyday life from the communities in which we find ourselves. Communities of practice are everywhere. Nearly everyone belongs to some community of practice, whether it is through our working colleagues or associates, our profession or trade, or our leisure interests, such as a book club. Wenger (2000) argues that a community of practice is different from a community of interest or a geographical community in that it involves a shared practice: ways of doing things that are shared to some significant extent among members.

#### Characteristics of A Community of Practice {-}

Wenger argues that there are three crucial characteristics of a community of practice:

1. **Domain:** A common interest that connects and holds together the community;  
2. **Community:** A community is bound by the shared activities they pursue (for example, meetings, discussions) around their common domain;  
3. **Practice:** Members of a community of practice are practitioners; what they do informs their participation in the community; and what they learn from the community affects what they do.  

Wenger (2000) has argued that although individuals learn through participation in a community of practice, more important is the generation of newer or deeper levels of knowledge through the sum of the group activity. If the community of practice is centered around business processes, for instance, this can be of considerable benefit to an organization. 

#### Types of Communities of Practice {-}

Today, communities of practices are increasingly being used to improve knowledge management and connect people within business, government, education, and other organizations.

The design of the community will look different depending on the purpose and needs of the participants. There are four basic types of communities:

1. **Helping Communities** provide a forum for community members to help each other with everyday work needs.  
2. **Best Practice Communities** develop and disseminate best practices, guidelines, and strategies for their members’ use.  
3. **Knowledge Stewarding Communities** organize, manage, and steward a body of knowledge from which community members can draw.  
4. **Innovation Communities** create breakthrough ideas, new knowledge, and new practices.  

As you reflect on digital practices in university and the workplace, consider how engaging in a Community of Practice could benefit you as a learner and in your future career.  

### Activity: What Is a Community of Practice? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

## Connecting and Learning through Social Media

### Activity: Mapping My Social Network {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Online communities are varied and can be categorized by their purpose: social, academic, professional, etc.  For this activity, we encourage you to consider what your purpose is in building an online community.  

1. What are your goals?

 - Do you want to connect with TWU peers internationally and in Canada?  Is your focus on academic support, or building personal relationships?  
 - Are you interested in the communities that relate to your chosen profession?  If so, do a quick search for online communities for a career that interests you (see example for businesses: [15 Best Online Community Platforms of 2023 (Ranked)](https://www.mightynetworks.com/resources/community-platforms){targt="_blank"}).   
 - Do you want to engage with online communities that align with your personal interests? (e.g. sports, arts, politics, gardening, coding, etc.)  

Write down your goals for joining an online community. 

2. Next, consider the networks you are currently a part of.  You may want to refer back to Unit 1 in which you created a [Personal Learning Network map](https://twu-innovation.github.io/inno101/introduction-to-digital-literacies-for-online-learning.html#activity-pln-mapping-challenge){target="_blank"}.  

Now, with a focus on networking, create your own Social Map.  See the following example from [Brian Solis](https://www.briansolis.com/about/){target="_blank"}, a digital analyst, anthropologist and author. 

<a title="Brian Solis Online - Social Map" href="https://flickr.com/photos/briansolis/2374839848" target="_blank"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3134/2374839848_2769ef5f1a.jpg" alt="Brian Solis Online - Social Map" /></a><br /><small><a title="Brian Solis Online - Social Map" href="https://flickr.com/photos/briansolis/2374839848">Brian Solis Online - Social Map</a> flickr photo by <a href="https://flickr.com/people/briansolis" target="_blank">The Brian Solis</a> shared under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons (BY) license</a></small>

3. Finally, **reflect** on the social media technologies you use for learning and how this impacts on your digital footprint and online identity.

## Connecting to the TWU Community

Our final topic focuses on the TWU community and how you can participate both online and on campus.  As a TWU student you have the opportunity to connect with a diverse student body, faculty and staff.  What role does technology play in how you communicate with your peers, collaborate on projects, and build relationships?  

In this unit we have discussed what it means to be a digital citizen, and how we can engage with online communities.  How does this apply to you as a TWU stude
nt?  As we wrap up this unit, we encourage you to reflect on your personal and academic goals and how you can engage with the TWU community.

### Activity: TWU's Learning Community {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Take a moment to re-read the course description for this course:

>Introduces theories and competencies related to learning and thriving in a digital world. Explores how learners are situated in 'the digital' throughout their lives and how they can use digital technologies to enhance and enrich their experience of learning, working, and playing. Learners will begin to build a curated digital footprint, initiate and develop personal and professional learning networks; develop competencies to allow them to evaluate and choose digital platforms and tools that are safe and ethical; and explore how to use digital technologies to discover, curate, connect, and share knowledge with their communities.

Next, focus on two key course learning outcomes:

> - Develop personal and professional learning networks to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens.

> - Create inclusive digital communities which embody a sense of belonging, connection, and Christian hospitality.


Finally, take a look at Trinity's [Life at TWU](https://www.twu.ca/life-twu){target="_blank"} website.   

> We invite all TWU students to connect, thrive, and serve in a dynamic, Christ-centred learning community where they can develop as maturing disciples, thoughtful global citizens, and compassionate servant leaders.
*Experience life and learning here.*

How might you connect, thrive, and serve through your connections and contributions online, as well as on campus?

What experiences have you had so far in connecting with your peers and getting to know the TWU community?  If you have not participated in the engagement opportunities presented in this course (Discourse, WordPress blog), take the time now to connect!

Once you arrive in Canada, there are more opportunities to connect on campus and online. Watch [Get Connected](https://vimeo.com/584977176/f1938444cb).

Data & Cloud Storage and Sharing
https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=128533

The only TWU approved Cloud Storage & Sharing services are Microsoft OneDrive, Microsoft SharePoint and OwnCloud. Cloud storage software provides web access to your online file storage, file sharing, and file synchronization.

The responsibility for storing TWU documents and files lies with the person who stores the data. Judgment is required about how and where TWU data will be stored.
TWU has a formal Information Security Policy and related Information Security Guidelines. This article provides some additional direction based on this set of policy and guidelines.
Different data is governed by different regulations, laws, agreements, and rules; each requires different means of protection and reporting.
 
What about other 3rd party cloud storage solutions (Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, WeChat etc...)?
In general, the use of unauthorized 3rd party cloud storage is not a good idea. TWU provides faculty and staff with the tools needed to collaborate internally and externally. The reasons below elaborate on the reasoning behind this position.

Lack of Visibility - Since these software are not integrated into our network, there is no way we can retrieve data stored in these systems if an employee or faculty member leaves the institution and fails to disclose the usage of that account, or has it attached to a personal email account. If TWU data are present in those accounts, then it can be easily lost or compromised, which can lead to institutional and legal consequences.
Lack of Accountability - There is no way to effectively manage information security if a faculty or staff member is using unauthorized cloud storage. Additionally, there is no way to know if those data have been compromised and no ability for our forensics team to conduct analyses on these data in the event of a security incident.
Lack of Support - We don't offer technical support to these services. So, if something goes wrong, is lost or compromised, IT will have no way to help users who have lost data or been locked out of accounts.
Collaboration - We each have our own preferences when it comes to the various technologies we like to work with. There is not always a best tool for everyone. However, collaboration becomes more difficult when each individual or department selects there own collaboration platforms, prioritizing individual needs above the whole.
Student Centred - We will put students first. These guidelines ensure we are protecting information and ultimately protecting our students. We have been entrusted with a great deal of personal and private information and must ensure the decisions we make are protecting that information. 
 
How to Share Data
With Microsoft OneDrive and SharePoint, you can securely share files internally and externally. However, it is important to understand the different Data Classification levels and acceptable ways to share your files (Data Protection Guidelines).

Guidance Table for Sharing Data

### Technology and Change {-}

Throughout history, there are technologies which have influenced change in society. Consider for example, the invention of the steam engine and its contribution to the Industrial Revolution. In more recent times, the advent of digital photography displaced Kodachrome (at one time, the market leader in colour film sales) which ceased production in 2009.


### Activity: Newspaper and Music Industry in a Digital Age  {-}

### Artificial Intelligence {-}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to have a significant impact on society and business. Examples include, autonomous cars, computers understanding human speech and machine learning. Consider for instance, that computer chess games available for commercial desktop machines have the ability to beat accomplished chess players including grand masters.  And of course, Chat GPT.  

In this section we introduce a few interesting examples of artificial intelligence to provide a sense of how sophisticated these technologies are becoming.

First, let's define AI:

> "The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages" ([Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095426960){target="_blank"})

> "The capacity of a computer to perform operations analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as by an expert system, a program for CAD or CAM, or a program for the perception and recognition of shapes in computer vision systems" ([Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial-intelligence){target="_blank"})

What is your experience with AI?  Have you used an AI tool, such as Grammerly or ChatGPT? How has this technology affected you as a student, and what effect do you think it has/will have on your chosen profession?  

In the next activity, we'll explore some of these questions and concerns.

### Activity: How Can I Use AI as a Student? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

First, do a quick search online for AI tools for university students. 
Examples:
- [How can AI be used by university students?](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/how-can-ai-be-used-university-students){target="_blank"}  
- [The 10 Best AI Tools to Help Students Learn Faster](https://mystudylife.com/10-best-ai-tools-to-help-students-learn-faster/){target="_blank"}  

Intrigued? Do you find any tech tools that you might use to help you with understanding course topics, studying, generating flashcards, transcribing lectures and voice notes, grammar, writing an essay, creating a slideshow presentation, drafting a forum discussion post, etc.?

Do any of these capabilites concern you?  Do you think they concern your professors or fellow students? 

Review TWU's policy on [Academic Misconduct & Fraud](https://www.twu.ca/about-us/policies-guidelines/university-policies/academic-misconduct-fraud){target="_blank"}.

Search online for key words related to this issue, such as "university concern policy artificial intelligence" and you will find numerous articles on the use of AI in universities, as well as emerging policies.  For example, the University of Toronto's guidelines for [ChatGPT and Generative AI in the Classroom](https://www.viceprovostundergrad.utoronto.ca/strategic-priorities/digital-learning/special-initiative-artificial-intelligence/){target="_blank"}

Here is one more article that discusses the pros and cons for English Learners using AI in their studies: [Perspectives of the Use of ChatGPT as a Tool for Online Education of English](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374483468_Perspectives_of_the_Use_of_ChatGPT_as_a_Tool_for_Online_Education_of_English){target="_blank"}

 

```

### Jobs and Automation {-}

In this section we consider the impact of automation on the future job market and the implications for education and training. Consider:

- Will robots replace humans?  
- What jobs are most at risk of being replaced by robots?  
- What are the implications for learning in a digital age?  

### Activity: Impact of Automation & AI in the Workplace {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

First, read [Collaborative Intelligence: Humans and AI Are Joining Forces](https://hbr.org/2018/07/collaborative-intelligence-humans-and-ai-are-joining-forces){target="_blank"} from Harvard Business Review.

Next, watch [*Humans Need Not Apply*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU){target="_blank"}

<div class ="video-container">

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Pq-S557XQU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

</div>

Finally, read [The Potential of Collaborative Intelligence for Social Media and Online Communities] by [Marcin Frąckiewicz](https://ts2.space/en/author/marcin/){target="_blank"}.

Consider your chosen field of study.  How can AI benefit your industry?  Are there any concerns regarding how AI might be used?

## Topic

**Digital Rights Management**

In a digital world, you may not have the full ownership rights you expect, or are accustomed to receiving in the physical world, when you buy digital content, resources, and equipment. In this section we explore digital rights management, geoblocking, and other examples. We highlight the importance users have to study the terms of reference and licenses when using proprietary software and buying products that rely on digital technology.

**Mini Challenge Summary**

**Summary:** Explore and discuss the impact of digital rights management. Time: 30–45 minutes. Consult the suggested resources and participate in the digital rights management debate.

<span class="prote">John Deere 9530 c.jpg</span>

**Digital Rights Management (DRM):** Digital rights management (DRM) describes the practice of imposing technical restrictions (hardware or software) to restrict what users can do with the digital content or operation of their equipment. 

**Examples include:**

- Film studios that embed software on their DVDs that restricts the number of copies a legal user can make to two.  
- Computer games that restrict the number of devices on which the game can be installed requiring server authentication to keep track of the number of installations.  
- e-Book publishers who restrict the ability to copy or print the materials.

**Reading**

- Layton, J. (Jan. 3, 2006). How Digital Rights Management Works. Retrieved July 4, 2017. (Click on the next button to progress the sub-pages of the article.)

**Geoblocking:** Geoblocking is a form of DRM which restricts access to content based on geographical location; for example, restrictions associated with media rights for sport coverage or films in different parts of the world because copyright holders sell broadcast and distribution rights to different companies around the world. Frequently, prices for streamed services of the same content will differ from country to country.

In another example, an individual who buys DVD films in one country and then emigrates to another country, may find that the playback of the legally purchased content is restricted by technology means in the new country of residence.

**Reading**

Geoblocking from Wikipedia;

EU lawmakers Include Spotify and iTunes in Geoblocking Ban from Reuters.

Case study - The Right to Repair

Do farmers have the right to repair their own tractors? Not necessarily, for example, John Deere’s proprietary software used to operate the vehicle does not allow “owners” to repair systems themselves and in effect they only have an implied license for life to operate the vehicle.

**Readings**

Choose one or two of the following readings (feel free to annotate using Hypothes.is and remember to tag your posts using the course code: lida102):

- We Can’t Let John Deere Destroy the Very Idea of Ownership from Wired.
- Why American Farmers are Hacking their own Tractors from the Guardian  
- A Right to Repair: Why Nebraska Farmers are Taking on John Deere and Apple from the Guardian.  
- The Fight for the “Right to Repair” from Smithsonian.com.  
- Outputs  

**Digital Rights Management Debate**

- Seeing both sides of a debate gives you the opportunity to better understand the issues. In this discussion, choose one of  

**the questions listed below and post to the DRM debate. Your post should include:**

- A sentence summarizing the issue.  
- The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is appropriate in a digital world.   
- The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is not appropriate in a digital world.  

<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider (optional)</span>

- Do you have personal experience of a DRM issue? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.  
- Do you have personal experience of a geoblocking issue? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.  
- Should owners of equipment have the right to repair? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.

**Societal Issues and the Internet**

<span class="prote">Abstract crowd.jpg</span>

In this subunit, we introduce a number of societal issues and problematic online behaviors that have emerged in the digital world. Our list is not comprehensive and does not provide a thorough examination of the issues. Here, we encourage you to choose an issue for further investigation.

You will choose one societal issue or antisocial behavior associated with the Internet that you would like to investigate further and publish as an editorial in your course blog. You will base your focus on your reading of open access resources you find online. Your blog post will also help you build your online identity.

### Activity: Forum: Philanthropy and corporate advertising  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Read the following case study:

The [OERu](https://oeru.org/){target="_blank"} is a charitable organisation which provides open online courses for free, using open educational resources which any educational institution can adopt, modify and reuse. There are costs that need to be covered to sustain the OERu: for example, the assembly of open online courses, hosting of the server and software infrastructure, staff to coordinate and support the initiative. etc. The OERu does not generate any revenue from corporate services, by, for example, allowing advertising on the OERu course sites for a share of the advertising revenue. Moreover, the OERu does not sell or generate revenue from personal data learners provide by using these free learning services, therefore users are not the product of this service.   

**Discussion**

Join the discussion on philanthropy and corporate advertising. The key question is how can non-profit organisations sustain free educational services for those who can’t afford traditional education provision?

Consider the following issues:

- As a learner, how would you feel if the course materials included corporate advertising? If advertising were to be supported, how would you feel if the OERu course sites required you to switch off any ad-blockers before gaining access to the course materials?  
- Is it appropriate for publicly funded institutions and charities working in education to generate revenue from corporate advertising to support and sustain free online services? What are the risks and opportunities?    
- Should education institutions and educational charities accept significant corporate sponsorship in return for profiling proprietary products?  
- The OERu has recommended that learners use free blogging services to share their learning outputs. Many of these services carry advertising. How do you feel about using these services – being the product rather than consumer? Would it be better for OERu to recommend that learners use a paid service without advertising? How would this impact on learners who do not have sufficient funds to afford maintaining a domain of their own?  
- Other?

### Net Neutrality {-}

> *“The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past.”*
>
>***— Time Berners-Lee***

The World Wide Web was originally designed to provide universal access to a large universe of documents. To achieve universal access, it was paramount to design the web as an open system without a central locus of control. However, on the Internet there are an increasing number of “walled gardens” that aim to control user’s access to content and services. In this section we explore the concept of net neutrality and reflect on the risks associated with universal access to online information.


### Activity: The Meaning of Net Neutrality  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Watch [Net Neutrality Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p90McT24Z6w){target="_blank"}

<div class ="video-container">

</div>

This video was produced in 2015, where the main concern of net neutrality seemed to relate to companies controlling our access to information on the internet.  Notice around the 2 minute mark where opposing political parties are supported/blamed for their view on the topic.)

Fast forward to 2023 where the concern is now government oversight in what information we see.

This issue is highly controversial and politisized.  If you are interested in exploring the topic...which means encountering diverse views on the subject, then read on!  As we learn with technology in this course and in life, we need to critically evaluate the information available on the internet and whether there are any restrictions on information that would help us as citizens to make informed decisions.

If interested, peruse the following resources.  ***Trigger alert!***  These perspective range from liberal to conservative points of view. This course aims to promote critical thinking of what we consume and produce online. Refer back to the video [Building More Creative Social Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acc4zY1sQ0o){target="_blank"}.  Will encountering an opposing point of view contribute to your understanding of an issue?

Let's dig in to some points on net neutrality!

<details>
<summary>**Facebook Zero: Am Attempt to Bring Access to All?**</summary>

Consider the following case study:

"[Facebook Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Zero){target="_blank"} is an application for mobile devices and business agreements with a number of companies to provide access to selected internet services without incurring data charges targeting markets where internet access may be less affordable. Facebook Zero is part of internet.org set up by Facebook and the basic websites than can be accessed for free without data charges are determined by the initiative."

...and then some criticism:

> "Facebook Zero became controversial in some countries due to several issues such as net neutrality.[9] For instance, India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) bans zero-rated services on account of "discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content”.[13] A criticism also stated that Facebook is practicing digital colonialism because it is not introducing open internet but building a "little web that turns the user into a mostly passive consumer of mostly western corporate content”.[11]"

In addition to the challenges associated with net neutrality, think about how closed technologies can build walled gardens, for example:

- The Apple iOS which is restricted to running pre-approved applications on the hardware purchased by the user.  
- The Amazon Kindle line of e-readers intentionally designed to favour the Amazon commercial ecosystem.  
- Video game consoles that typically require game developers to purchase a license to develop games for the platform frequently requiring approval from the platform prior to publishing the games.

## Digital Wisdom

To conclude our course, we will examine another perspective on ethics and technology.  This may tap into the foundational lens by which you approach many ethical issues, so take a moment to reflect on the following:

- What role does technology play in my social, academic, and spiritual life?  
- What guidance does the Bible have on our use of technology today?  
- How will my use of technology support my social, academic, and spiritual goals?  
  
### Activity: Digital Wisdom  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Skim the following article in which the authors present a framework for digital wisdom, as well as practical practices that can help navigate the digital in our daily lives. 

- [A Framework for Digital Wisdom in Higher Education](https://christianscholars.com/a-framework-for-digital-wisdom-in-higher-education/){target="_blank"}

Here are some quotes that resonate with me.  Feel free to highlight your quotes using Hypothes.is, or in your personal Obsidian notes.  

> "Institutions of higher education have a crucial role and responsibility at this moment of technological change to form people who will flourish in our so-called digital age." (para 1)

> "Within the context of Christian higher education, the need to integrate new ICTs into our individual and institutional lives well and wisely—as we consider what technologies are doing to us and what we will do with them—is of utmost significance if we are committed to the cultivation of competence, character, and wisdom." (para 6)

> "Scripture enables us look behind and beyond our and others’ online identities to see ourselves and others as embodied and relational beings made in the image of God." (para 21)

> "Our use of technologies must be shaped by our intentions and values, and we must be aware of how platform interfaces, permissions, algorithms, and other design elements could interfere with our goals and obligations." (para 31)

<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider</span>

Answer the following questions in your personal journal:  

- How can you, as a TWU student, flourish in this digital age?
