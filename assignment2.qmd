# Assignment 2: Digital Citizenship Blog {.unnumbered}

## Part 1: Blog Posts {.unnumbered}

After completing Units 1-5, including the learning activities, you are asked to share your blog posts demonstrating the knowledge you have gained on the concept of digital citizenship.

This assignment is based on the learning activities in Units 4 and 5, as well as the skills practices in previous units. Note that you can control the privacy settings of each blog post (e.g., so only your instructor can see it, or for the TWU community, or open access for all). You may have chosen to complete some activities in your journal; please share any relevant entries to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes.

## Part 2: Written Reflection {.unnumbered}

Prepare a learning reflection of about 500–600 words reflecting on the development of your understanding of digital citizenship.

In your reflective post, provide the following:

-   Your personal description of digital citizenship
-   Your revised definition of digital citizenship based on your research of the topic
-   A list of university-level study examples of the elements of digital citizenship
-   A summary of the primary rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age

To help you structure your writing, see the following video on [Reflective Writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SntBj0FIApw){target="_blank"}

Your post should cover the following aspects:

-   **Describe** what happened. What was a highlight from our discussion on digital citizenship?
-   **Interpret** the events. How did it make you feel? What was “good” and “bad” about the experience?
-   **Evaluate** the effectiveness. What did you learn from it? How beneficial or useful was this discussion?
-   **Plan** for the future. What new knowledge or skills do you have and how will your experience inform future learning?

Add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: ldrs101. Post a comment on one or two blog contributions from your peers.

## Part 3: Video Reflection {.unnumbered}

For the third part of this assignment, you are asked to create a short video (under 5 minutes) describing your learning process as it relates to our course learning outcomes. Reflect on your demonstration of the following skills:

1.  Build and customize technology-integrated workflows to enhance and enrich your learning journey.
2.  Apply digital literacy skills to evaluate the legitimacy, credibility and reliability of online resources for academic study.
3.  Practice evaluative judgment to document your process of learning in complex domains of knowledge.
4.  Create a personalized narrative to document and express your learning process
5.  Evaluate digital tools, platforms, and interactions based on ethical principles.
6.  Develop personal and professional learning networks to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens.
7.  Create inclusive digital communities which embody a sense of belonging, connection, and Christian hospitality.

Post your video reflection on your blog. Remember that you control the privacy settings, so you can share your video blog with the instructor, your peers, and others outside Trinity if you wish.
