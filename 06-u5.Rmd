Social media for learning

Exploring how social media can support online learning and implications for engagement and identity

Review social media technologies and how they can support or inhibit learning in a digital age.
Reflect on engagement in online communities.
Consider the relationship between sharing learning online and your digital footprint and online identity.

Annotation - Learners on the periphery

Read: Using social media for learning. A guide to becoming strategic published by Sheffield Hallam University.
Explore: The conversation prism developed by Brian Solis.
Reflect on what social media technologies you use for learning and how this impacts on your digital footprint and online identity.
Share what social media technologies you use to support learning and how you use them by posting a WENote, for example:

I use <insert tool> to <describe purpose and how it supports your learning>
In the future, I plan to use <insert tool> to <describe purpose and how it will support your learning>

Frameworks for online engagement

Read the following article and add or reply to annotations using  on the  Hypothes.is focusing on how the research might apply to your own behaviour. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LiDA102. (Consult the OERu support site for help on using the Hypothes.is annotation tool.)

Honeychurch, S., Bozkurt, A., Singh, L., & Koutropoulos, A. (2017). Learners on the Periphery: Lurkers as Invisible Learners. European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning, 20(1). (Direct hypothes.is link.)

Read Derek Wenmouth’s blog post: Participation online – Four C’s (How does this apply to your own online engagement?).
Watch the following video based on Ross Mayfield’s power law of participation. Note how low threshold engagement on social media leaves a bread crumb (digital footprint) and generates a form of collective intelligence. Higher forms of engagement result in collaborative intelligence (note that Cheryl Reynolds refers to Yammer in the video, but the framework also applies to other social media platforms). When viewing the video, think about how you engage in different online communities.

### Activity: Blog: My Online Biography (Optional) {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this challenge you are asked to build or update your professional online biography and the “About” page of your course blog. 

1. Reflect on the following online personas, target audience and how this will impact on the style and voice of the communication medium.  

| **Persona**  | **Primary audience**               |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Personal     | Friends and family                 |
| Professional | (Future) Employers and professional network |
| Academic     | Peer learning network              |


2. Choose the most appropriate medium for each of your online personas, for example:    

| **Persona**  | **Medium example**                    |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Personal     | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) |
| Professional | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) |
| Academic     | Learning blog or website                |


3. Identify one or two professionals from your field of interest who maintain an active web presence and contribute regularly via social media. Explore their respective websites and professional listings as examples.  
- X (formerly Twitter) is a good place to search for individuals using popular hashtags from your field or area of study, for example “#highereducation”.    
- Click through to their respective X user page. If they have a personal website listed on the user page, visit the site and review their “About” page.  
- Visit their employer’s page and try to locate their biography on the employer’s website.  
- Search for the user on Linkedin  
- Compare the user information on these different sites. Observe how they link to social media accounts, and vary the style and content presented for the different personas.

4. Create or update your professional profile on Linkedin. 
- Consult TWU's [Student Resources website](Student Resources
) about LinkedIn.) TWU gives you access to LinkedIn Learning, which includes several great courses and videos, such as [Rock Your LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/rock-your-linkedin-profile/connect-to-opportunity-with-linkedin?u=124451074). 

5. Create or update your “About” page on your Learning Blog. You may prefer using a more informal style for this page aligned with your own personality and interests. Include links to your professional profile and respective links to social media that you use.

6. Visit the profile pages of your active social media accounts. Update if necessary providing links back to your main page (for example, the “About” page on your website).

7. Think carefully about information you post publicly and keep a clear distinction between your personal online presence and your professional online persona. Review your privacy settings on your personal account(s).
