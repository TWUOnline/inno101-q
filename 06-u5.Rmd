## Digital Citizenship

Before attempting to define *digital citizenship*, let's consider the concept of citizenship in its own right. In its simplest form, citizenship refers to the rights, privileges and duties of being a national citizen. However, the concept of being a good citizen encompasses much more, particularly if you think about full engagement as a member of society.  

>“Citizenship is a status that is bestowed on those who are full members of a community.”  
>—T.H. Marshall




### Activity: Reflecting on Digital Citizenship {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}


If good citizenship means to fulfill your role as citizen, can you think of five things good citizens do? Consider the following questions:

- In a digital world, is loyalty to your country a necessary component of the definition of good citizenship?  
- Is education a pre-requisite for good citizenship?  
- In a digital world, what does it mean to be a global citizen? Read the Wikipedia article on [Global Citizenship Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_citizenship_education) where learners engage in solving real world problems.  
-  Has the concept of good citizenship changed over time? In what ways?  
- Does citizenship require active community engagement? Read this post by Kristen Mattson, director of a high school library media center: [John Dewey Would Hate Your Digital Citizenship Curriculum](https://drkmattson.wordpress.com/2016/08/03/john-dewey-would-hate-your-digital-citizenship-curriculum/).  
- Why has the concept *digital* been linked with *citizenship* or should we drop the word *digital* and just talk about *good citizenship*?  

Write your thoughts in your Reflective Journal (using Obsidian or WordPress).

Conclude by writing down a description of “digital citizenship” in your own words. (You will need this later for the assessment. It does not need to be a scholarly definition – just your personal thoughts on the concept.)

```

### Defining Digital Citizenship {-}

Defining digital citizenship is not easy because it means different things to different people. It is also a concept which is debated among scholars researching the field.  

If you conduct a general search for “digital citizenship” you will find many links referencing resources targeting the school-level, with a focus on safe, skilled and ethical use of online technology. While these aspects are important, for the purposes of this tertiary-level course, we need to explore the concept of digital citizenship in more detail.  


### Activity: Podcast on Digital Citizenship {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity you will listen to a podcast that focuses on the people dimension of digital citizenship.

Meet [Autumm Caines](http://autummcaines.com/), associate director of academic technology from the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching at Capital University in a podcast with Bonni Stachowiak.

Listen to the first 15–20 minutes of this Teaching in HigherEd podcast on Digital citizenship. The podcast introduces aspects of digital citizenship and the learner experience in starting out with engagement with social media.


```

### Activity: Refined Definition of Digital Citizenship {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

The purpose of this activity is to explore the elements of digital citizenship with particular emphasis on those relevant to your academic study.  

Read through the following resources in order to refine your own definition of what it means to be a Digital Citizen.

*Step 1: Online Search:*
- Read the introductory section of the Wikipedia article: [Digital citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_citizen)  
- Conduct a general search for “definition of digital citizen.” Choose the two best definitions and add these to the library of your citation management tool (Hypothes.is / Zotero / Obsidian), or keep a record for citation purposes.  
- Try and locate one recent scholarly definition for “digital citizen.” Record the reference for citation purposes. How recent is the reference?  

*Step 2: Social Media Search:*
- Explore the recent tweets (on X or whichever social media app you prefer) using the following hashtags: #digitalcitizenship, #digiciz, and #digicit.  Compile a list of elements relating to the concept of digital citizenship.  

*Step 3: Read & Comment:*
- Login to hypothes.is.  
- Read [Nine elements of digital citizenship](https://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html) by Mike Ribble  
- Feel free to add or reply to annotations using Hypothes.is. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: #LDRS399 (This is needed to harvest posts for the course feed.)  


*Step 4: Apply the Elements*
Generate a table listing the nine elements of digital citizenship and identify a practical example of the element for your academic study: For example:  

| **Element**  | **Academic Study Example**               |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Digital access     | Students from low income countries may not have reliable or affordable access to the Internet.                 |
| Digital commerce  |  |
| Digital communication     |               |
| Digital literacy     |                  |
| Digital etiquette  |  |
| Digital law      |              |
| Digital rights and responsibilities     |                  |
| Digital health and wellness |  |
| Digital security       |               |
	  
  
*Step 4: Define digital citizenship*
After completing the steps above, revise your personal description of digital citizenship. Does your new definition differ from your initial description?  

*Step 4: Share Your Insights!*
Share a reflection on this activiy by posting either in your blog or on the Discourse forum.

For example:

I didn’t realize the <insert element> is part of digital citizenship because …  
<insert element> is not particularly relevant for tertiary learners because …  
<insert element> is particularly relevant for tertiary learners because …  

```

### Rights and Responsibilities {-}
The concept of citizenship encompasses the rights and responsibilities of individuals. We need to consider what rights and responsibilities come with digital citizenship. In this mini challenge, we explore this topic with particular emphasis on the rights and responsibilities associated with learning in a digital age.

Following the hype of massive open online courses (MOOC) and the New York Times declaring 2012 the “year of the MOOC,“ a small group of educators drafted “A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in a Digital Age.” This document forms the basis for a course discussion on the rights and responsibilities of digital citizens.



### Activity: Rights & Responsibilities of Digital Citizens {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Read A Proposal for Rights and Responsibilities for Citizens in the Digital World with particular reference to identifying rights and responsibilities appropriate for college-level online study. Note that the publication is almost a decade old. Is this list still relevant today? What would you amend or add to update this proposal.   
Conduct a general search for rights and responsibilities of digital citizenship to assist in refining your own list for tertiary online study. Your search is likely to generate many results developed for the school sector, so you need to evaluate if these rights and responsibilities are appropriate for tertiary.  
Udacity version of the bill of rights  
Read the the following news editorials on the bill of rights:  
‘Bill of Rights’ Seeks to Protect Students’ Interests as Online Learning Rapidly Expands, from the Chronicle of Higher Education.  
Critique of ‘Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in the Digital Age’ from Inside Higher Ed.  
Prepare a table summarising the primary rights and responsibilities for tertiary learning in a digital age.  
Remember to annotate and comment on the Hypothes.is and tag your contributions using the course code: #lida102  
Topical Issues – Rights and Responsibilities for Learning in a Digital Age  
Drawing on your knowledge and experience, please join the discussion on topical issues regarding rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age at the tertiary level. You can discuss the topical issues listed below, or add new ones to the forum. In each case, justify your position taking opposing views into account.  

Topical Issues

- Should higher education institutions have the right to determine what software applications learners should use for their studies?  
- Data generated by learners belongs to the learners, therefore should they have the right to access their data (for example forum discussion contributions) even after the course has completed?   
- Should higher education institutions reserve the right to ban disruptive learners from their learning platforms?  
- Where legally permissible, should learners have the right to access all course materials without the need to register a password?  
- Should higher education institutions have the right to limit the time required for completing a course?  
- Others?  

We encourage learners to reply and “like” good posts. (Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS399).

### Online Communities {-}

In this section we explore the topic of online communities

contrast and compare online communities with offline communities. We consider the research on online communities to derive practical advice on how to join and contribute constructively to these digital communities. If you don’t have much experience with online communities, participate in the course forums and become an active member of the TWU online learning family.


### Activity: Online vs. "Real Communities" {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Contrast and compare the similarities and differences between online and real, or in-person, communities. For example:

Online and real communities both congregate around shared interests.
In the absence of body language, it is hard to decipher emotional intent with written communications in online discussion forums.

In your Reflective Journal or Blog, share a similarity or difference you identified, for example:

- Online communities are different because …
- Real communities are different because …
- Online and real communities are similar because …

In the early years of the internet, there was a strong research interest in studying the differences between virtual and real communities. However, in more recent years, we have observed a blurring of the boundaries between online and real communities. Read the following article:

Michalk, A. (2013, June 27). [The difference between online & real life community?](https://quiip.com.au/is-there-a-definitive-difference-between-online-and-real-life-community/) 

So, what are the implications for you as a TWU student?  
- How are you involved in the TWU online community?  
- What kind of connections would you like to make

hiding section - I don't think it's needed. 

Research on online communities
Research on the efficacy of online communities provides insights on selecting productive communities and how to engage. Community contributors can be classified into three types (Mocus et al 2002[1]):

Core members are responsible for guiding the development of the community and have usually been involved with the community for a long time. These members have made significant contributions to the community’s evolution and have earned leadership status. Frequently they also play an active role in moderation of the group.
Active members make regular contributions to the community.
Peripheral members occasionally contribute to the discussions and the periods of engagement are short and sporadic. “Lurkers”, that is individuals seeking answers without making contributions, are normally associated with this group.
The nature of engagement in a community is influenced by the community’s life cycle stage (A. Iriberri and G. Leroy 2009[2]):

Life cycle stage	Characteristics
Inception stage	Focus is on determining the purpose, codes of conduct, funding and sustainability.
Creation stage	User-centred design and evolution including issues of privacy, anonymity, open versus closed communications.
Growth stage	Focus is on community building, for example: recruiting members, growth management, integrating new members, trust building, up-to-date content, interaction support, a few offline and online events and meetings.
Maturity stage	By this stage a community culture will have emerged with identifiable community leaders. Focus shifts to permeated management and control, recognition of contributions, recognition of loyalty, member satisfaction management and subgroup management.
Additional factors identified by the research to keep in mind include:

Network cohesion, that is the overall level of connections indicated by the network density has a positive impact on the core group as well as the success of the community (Toral et al 2010[3]).
Network structure. Successful communities need a critical mass of contributors, however there is no fixed number that determines success. Most communities can expect between 45 – 90% of non-active members, but communities with a strong and experienced core group will have a positive impact on success (Toral et al 2010[3]). Moreover, the positive effects of network structure on participation persist irrespective of the life cycle stage of the community, and activity participation influences network structure (Igl 2014[4]).
Centralization. Communities with a high degree of centralisation and control exerts a negative impact on all participation variables. (Igl 2014[4]).
Practical implications
There are many online communities, and it will be worth your effort in doing a little online research to determine the network cohesion and network structure of the community. You will be able to determine this by reviewing the archive history. Avoid communities with overly centralised control, in the long run, they are not likely to be productive.

When joining an online community, try to identify the life cycle stage by scanning the archive of posts. Young communities are likely to be more tolerant of newbie questions, as responses to these questions will provide support resources for new members in the future. It’s a good idea to search the forum for your answer before posting a question. Don’t be surprised if newbie questions go answered in mature communities, they may can even attract curt rebuttals. If you’re a long standing member of the community, post a tactful reply, for example, “Your question has already been answered” and post a link to the appropriate reply.

The best advice when joining a new community is to lurk for a while before introducing yourself so that you can become familiar with the culture and practices of the community. Fill out your profile page on the forum site, rather than posting a biography in the main discussion threads. Of course, if the community is in the creation phase, you may want to play a more active role in building the community and becoming part of the core contributors.

### Activity: Blog: My Online Biography (Optional) {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this challenge you are asked to build or update your professional online biography and the “About” page of your course blog. 

1. Reflect on the following online personas, target audience and how this will impact on the style and voice of the communication medium.  

| **Persona**  | **Primary audience**               |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Personal     | Friends and family                 |
| Professional | (Future) Employers and professional network |
| Academic     | Peer learning network              |


2. Choose the most appropriate medium for each of your online personas, for example:    

| **Persona**  | **Medium example**                    |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Personal     | [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) |
| Professional | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) |
| Academic     | Learning blog or website                |


3. Identify one or two professionals from your field of interest who maintain an active web presence and contribute regularly via social media. Explore their respective websites and professional listings as examples.   
- X (formerly Twitter) is a good place to search for individuals using popular hashtags from your field or area of study, for example “#highereducation”.    
- Click through to their respective X user page. If they have a personal website listed on the user page, visit the site and review their “About” page.  
- Visit their employer’s page and try to locate their biography on the employer’s website.  
- Search for the user on Linkedin  
- Compare the user information on these different sites. Observe how they link to social media accounts, and vary the style and content presented for the different personas.

4. Create or update your professional profile on Linkedin. 
- Consult TWU's [Student Resources website](Student Resources
) about LinkedIn.) TWU gives you access to LinkedIn Learning, which includes several great courses and videos, such as [Rock Your LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/rock-your-linkedin-profile/connect-to-opportunity-with-linkedin?u=124451074). 

5. Create or update your “About” page on your Learning Blog. You may prefer using a more informal style for this page aligned with your own personality and interests. Include links to your professional profile and respective links to social media that you use.

6. Visit the profile pages of your active social media accounts. Update if necessary providing links back to your main page (for example, the “About” page on your website).

7. Think carefully about information you post publicly and keep a clear distinction between your personal online presence and your professional online persona. Review your privacy settings on your personal account(s).

<span class="blockhead">Digital Citizenship Challenge</span>

After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to prepare a learning reflection based on the knowledge you have gained on the concept of digital citizenship. 

This learning challenge is based on the learning activities in this unit. You are encouraged to complete this assignment on your blog.  Note that you can control the privacy settings of each post (e.g. only you can see it > only your instructor > your TWU peers > open to all who come across it on the web!). 

In your Reflective post, provide the following:  
- your personal description of digital citizenship;  
- your revised definition of digital citizenship based on your research of the topic;  
- list of university-level study examples of the elements of digital citizenship;  
- a summary of the primary rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age;  

Resources: 
- video on [How to Write a Reflection Essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk2GjRIRBIk) by Melissa Wehler

In addition to the tasks above, prepare a learning reflection of about 500–600 words reflecting on the development of your understanding of digital citizenship.

Your post should cover the following aspects:

**Description**: Provide your reader with specifically what happened?  
**Evaluation**: What was “good” and “bad” about the experience?  
**Analysis**: What did you learn from it? How do you feel about it now? Did it change you? How?  
**Conclusion**: What alternatives did you have at the time or what else could you have done?  
**Plan**: What new knowledge or skills do you have and how will your experience inform future learning?
