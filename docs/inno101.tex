\begin{reflect}
\textbf{\emph{Feel free to answer the questions above in your notes or Reflective Learning Journal}}.

{Introduction to the Reflective Journaling}

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun.
The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course's readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work.
Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities.

\textbf{Common Questions Used for Reflective Journaling} - Click to expand

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In your view, what were the most important points in the readings, videoclips, or discussions with your peers?\\
\item
  What information did you already know?\\
\item
  What new knowledge, ideas, or perspectives have you gained?\\
\item
  What information was easy to remember or learn? Why?\\
\item
  What concepts did you find more difficult? Why?\\
\item
  How can you apply this knowledge to your work or current experience?\\
\item
  How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience?\\
\item
  Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts?\\
\item
  Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why?\\
\item
  If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be?\\
\item
  What further questions would like to ask the author of your readings?\\
\item
  What other articles, books or discussions would be of interest?
\end{itemize}

\emph{For any journal assignments in your courses, please refer to the specific questions and/or grading
criteria to help you in your writing.}

\textbf{Note:} The learning activities in this course are ungraded, unless specified. They are designed to help you succeed in your assessments in this course, so you are strongly encouraged to complete them.
