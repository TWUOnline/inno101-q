Introduction to the Reflective Journaling A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities. Common Questions Used for Reflective Journaling - Click to expand In your view, what were the most important points in the readings, videoclips, or discussions with your peers? What information did you already know? What new knowledge, ideas, or perspectives have you gained? What information was easy to remember or learn? Why? What concepts did you find more difficult? Why? How can you apply this knowledge to your work or current experience? How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience? Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts? Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why? If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be? What further questions would like to ask the author of your readings? What other articles, books or discussions would be of interest? For any journal assignments in your courses, please refer to the specific questions and/or grading criteria to help you in your writing. 1.2 Personal Learning Environments … The primary purpose of this topic is to enable you to set up your course blog, which will form the hub of your Personal Learning Environment (PLE). Blog posts are a useful way of reflecting on your learning and a means to network with your peers. It also provides our learning community with a way to see how you are getting on and to help where we can. The purpose of a PLE is to put the learner at the centre of the online learning environment, which will be enabled by establishing a personal blog for this course. Using a course blog: You will retain control of your data and learning outputs generated during this online course, even after the course is completed. You get to choose: - The blog service you would like to use, although we recommend WordPress as it is supported by TWU. - Whether to accept comments on your blog from your peers - Whether to register your blog for the aggregated course feed so that any posts tagged with the course code (LiDA101) will be harvested for the feed. A key teaching philosophy of this course is to embed the acquisition of new digital literacies into your learning journey. Knowledge of how to use the Internet and social media technologies will better prepare you for life in a digital world. If this is your first time blogging, you should spend time in setting up your personal digital learning environment. In this course, you will also use social media technologies to interact with fellow students. The advantage is that you will control and retain access to all the content and learning artefacts you create during this course, even after its conclusion. Please remember that your course blog and the social media technologies you use on this course are public, and that you take full responsibility for anything you publish. Do not disclose any confidential information and respect the privacy of your employer, colleagues and friends. In short, don’t say anything that you would not want to read on the Internet. Activity: … Download and read “7 Things you should know about personal learning environments”. Read Why you need a Personal Learning Network by Education Technology Solutions. Questions to Consider After watching the video, consider the following: … Activity: Setting up your course blog As this is a course focusing on digital literacies, you are asked to establish a course blog, as this will improve your skills and enable you to network with your peers. We recommend using WordPress, as it is supported by TWU. Follow the steps below to set up your blog. Register an account and create a free blog on WordPress.com. Determine the difference between the dashboard used for editing and the published view of your blog. (It is important to know the difference because, when you register your blog for the course feed, you must use the url for the public view of your blog). Do you know how to open the published (public view) of your blog in a new window? Have you added a browser bookmark to your dashboard and public version of your blog? Complete your personal details for display on the “About” page of your blog. Can you see the updates on your “about” page in the published view of your blog? Review and customise your blog settings from the dashboard according to your preferences. We recommend that you enable categories and tags on your blog. Consider whether you want to moderate all comments or, in the case of WordPress, you can also enable previously approved posters to post comments without moderation. Conduct a web search on “moderating blog comments” to find out more about the pros and cons on the flow of information when moderating comments. Visit the appearance option on your dashboard and personalise your blog by: Changing: your theme, header image, background colours and/or image Add at least one widget to your blog — remember “less is more“. One or two of the following are functional choices: Archives, recent posts, categories or category cloud, and blogs I follow. Draft a blog post, reflecting on your experience of this e-Learning activity on creating a blog. Click on “save draft” (so you can review before publishing live on the web). Your reflection could for example: Introduce yourself and reflect on what you would like to achieve by maintaining a blog to support your learning Reflect on what you thought of the activity; Was it easy or hard? Share links to any additional resources you found useful in completing the tasks. Provide tips for future learners who will be completing this activity. If you were to set up a new blog again, what would you do differently? Add anything your readers may find interesting or useful. Choose a photo to add to your blog post. Be sure you have permission to upload the photo. We sugest using an open licence site, such as pixabay or… Alternatively, upload your own photo, take a selfie or ask someone to take a photo of you working on this blog post challenge. Optional: Record a short video introduction and embed this in your blog post. Review your draft post and, when you’re happy with what you’ve written, click on the “Publish post” button. Add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LDRS101 Post in the LDRS 101 Discourse forum to let your peers know the web address of your blog and ask them to post a comment. This will give you the opportunity to experience how comments function on your blog and to test if they are working properly. 1.3 Online Identity for Learning add intro paragraph Your digital footprint matters, published by the Internet Society. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro_LlRg8rGg&amp;t=1s - Four Reasons to Care About Your Digital Footprint Julia Angwin, author of “Dragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security, and Freedom in a World of Relentless Surveillance” attempted to erase her digital footprint. Watch this short CBS This Morning interview with Julia: … Activity: Digital Footprint Audit In this activity you will audit your own digital footprint in order to find out what exists on the internet about you, and reflect on what you want your online identity to be. Follow the steps below to begin. Conduct a Google search of your own name (using an incognito or private window in Chrome or Firefox). Search for your first name and surname without parenthesis (for example: snow white) and then with parenthesis (for example: “snow white”). Explore the results of your search. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of current and previous employers. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of previous schools you attended. Expand your search to include social media sites, for example: “snow white” twitter; “snow white” facebook; “snow white” youtube etc. Note any interesting or surprising findings. Questions to Consider After watching the video, consider the following: … Activity: Blog: My Digital Footprint Prepare and publish a short blog post of about 250 to 300 words focusing on what you hope to achieve with your online digital identity for learning. Your post can include: Optional reflection: You may want to include a reflection(s) on the outcomes of your footprint audit. Remember that your blog post is public, so only share what you are comfortable sharing with the world. You don’t need to be specific; for example, you can generalise: I am satisfied with my digital footprint because … or I would like to improve my digital footprint for learning because … Professional versus private: Consider how you want to separate your “private” online identity from your professional and / or learning identity. If you already maintain an online presence (existing blog, twitter and/or facebook accounts) think about how you will separate professional / learning posts from private and social life interactions online. For example, maintaining a separate course or learning blog is one way to achieve this distinction. Will you link your personal online identities (e.g.an existing Twitter username or Facebook account) with your learning blog? Will you link your professional online identity (e.g. published online biography on your employer’s web site) with your learning blog? Objectives: List a few objectives for developing or improving your online identity. Remember to add a category or tag to your post using the course tag: LDRS101 (This is needed to harvest links to posts from registered course blogs for the course feed.) Remember: You are in charge of what you post online and deciding what you would like to share for your digital identity for the purposes of this course. Don’t share high risk personal details like physical address, date of birth, name of first pet etc., which may make it easier for identity thieves to appear more credible. If unsure, consult online resources for internet safety; for example Netsafe New Zealand. (replace resource) !! Note that we will cover online identity in more depth in Unit 5. 1.4 Digital Literacies In this unit we’ve started discussing ‘the digital’, you have started a blog (part of your PLN), and you’ve examined your own digital identity. In our final topic, we want to begin to define digital literacies, and continue to build digital skills. So, what is digital literacy? In the next activity, you will start to unpack this term and prepare your own initial definition of digital literacy. Activity: Definining Digital Literacy Purpose: Search for definitions of digital literacy and digital skills on the web to identify the difference. Read Wikipedia’s definition of Digital literacy – Is this a good description? Scan the #diglit hashtag on Twitter – Did you find any valuable links to defining digital literacy? Conduct a Google search for “digital literacy.” Select a few definitions you like and record the urls, for example by adding these to your browser bookmarks. Conduct a Google search for “digital skills.” Select one or two definitions you like and record the urls. Conduct a Google search for “digital fluency” Select one or two definitions. What are the differences between digital literacies, digital fluency, and digital skills? How are these concepts related? Read: What is digital literacy? published by POMO – Is this a reliable source? How would you rate the academic quality of the definitions you found (e.g. low / high quality)? What did you discover? Share your thoughts and experiences by posting on the LDRS101 Discourse channel. For example: The major difference between digital skills and literacies is … I didn’t realise that … For me, digital literacy means …” Note: Your comment will be displayed in the course feed. … 1.4.1 Digital skills versus literacies “Saying that any digital tool teaches us digital literacies is like saying a pen or a keyboard teaches us writing.” —Maha Bali (Bali_Maha?) “Digital literacies are not solely about technical proficiency but about the issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose.” —Doug Belshaw, Educational researcher Activity: Digital skills versus literacies In this activity, we will review an article on the difference between digital skills and digital literacies using Hypothes.is – an online social annotation technology. Purpose Read an online article and annotate it using Hypothes.is. Tasks Read the Hypothes.is “Quick start guide for students” Create an account on Hypothes.is. Here is the registration link We recommend that you use the Chrome browser (download here) and install the Hypothes.is extension.

Activity: Researching a definition This course is facilitated and enabled by resources that learners can access on the Internet. This involves the ability to search, evaluate, and select resources to support your learning. A key feature of a PLE is the ability to share useful and valuable information with your peers. In this activity, you will complete your first resource bank activity, where you are invited to search for additional resources to help you refine and develop your own definition of digital literacies, and to reflect on how this differs from definitions for digital skills. The resource bank activity builds on your initial search on the previous page by inviting you to share links to valuable resources you source on the Internet. The resource bank provides the technology to share these resources with our LDRS 101 learning community. The resource bank for this course is hosted on …(Obsidian? Evernote? Moodle wiki? Google doc?) is an open source social bookmarking application which enables users to share and annotate links to resources they find on the web. It uses a tag system to group resources according to different topics. The tag system helps users to locate links to resources on the site using the same tag. The purpose of this activity is to find and select online definitions for digital literacies and digital skills, and to record and share these links using the OERu resource bank. This activity is designed to give you the opportunity to familiarise yourself with our shared resource bank, which is hosted on the bookmarks.oeru.org site.

As you explore the concept, you will find online resources which confuse digital skills with digital literacies. The activities which follow aim to provide an initial introduction to the wide range of digital literacies associated with academic learning. We will explore the concept of digital literacies in greater depth as we progress with the course. When exploring these online resources, we encourage you to differentiate between skills and literacies and to develop a critical disposition. Digtial literacies involve issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose. However, these literacies are closely related to technical proficiency in using a range of digital applications Activity: Am I Digitally Literate? Digital literacies encompasses a wide range of capabilities which extend beyond the digital skills associated with different technologies. Study the graphic depicting the Seven elements of digital literacies (scroll down the page to view the graphic). (replace) Jot down one or more technologies or tools you would recommend for each of the seven elements in the graphic and assess your competence in using each particular technology/tool (eg below average, average, above average and excellent). Next, use your searching skills to discover the range and scope of digital literacies (Don’t spend more than 15 to 20 minutes on the self-assessment activity). Conduct a Google search using: “digital literacy self-assessment” Choose a link to conduct a self-assessment of your digital literacy. Alternatively, you can: Try the iTest developed by the University of Exeter or Explore the What is digital literacy? page of the Digital Literacies Toolkit developed by the University of Southampton. Questions to consider Did the self-assessment you chose focus on digital skills or digital literacies? What did you learn from this exercise?
