Course Activities Below is some key information on features you will see throughout the course. Learning Activity This box will prompt you to engage in course concepts, often by viewing resources and reflecting on your experience and/or learning. Most learning activities are ungraded and are designed to help prepare you for the assessment in this course. Assessment This box will signify an assignment you will submit in Moodle. Note that assignments demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes. Be sure to review the grading rubrics for each assignment. Checking Your Learning This box is for checking your understanding, to make sure you are ready for what follows. Note This box signifies key notes, important quotes, or case students. It may also warn you of possible problems or pitfalls you may encounter! Course Technologies This course is about learning with technology. Digital literacies are closely linked but not limited to digital skills. Consequently, this course will use a number of different online communication and publishing technologies to support your learning. An open philosophy of inclusion Learning in a digital age incorporates a wide range of online technologies and software applications. The OERu has a strong commitment to free and open source software because we believe that no learner should be denied access to learning for lack of funds to purchase a proprietary software license. Nor do we believe that you should be forced to sacrifice your freedoms in software choice. The OERu course resources and interaction technologies are based entirely on free and open source software and you will be able to complete all the learning activities using open source applications without the need to purchase any software. You are free to use proprietary technology applications of your choice, but you can also use this course to explore and experiment with open technology. Summary of technologies used on this course You do not need a password to access the course materials. However, if you want to post comments and /or receive instructions via email you will need to register an account on the course site by clicking on the “head graphic” at the top of your screen. Your registration login details will provide you with authenticated access to most of the course technologies hosted by OERu. In some cases you will need to register separate accounts for technologies that are run independently of the LiDA course. The following table provides a summary of the main technologies used in this course. Technology Details Moodle TWU uses Moodle as our Learning Management System. For LDRS 101, your course notes, assignment instructions, assignment dropboxes will be found in Moodle. Note that some assignments require you to complete your work in WordPress and Discourse. Course resources Course materials are organized into the Course Book tab in Moodle and contain the instructions to guide your learning. Bookmark this page in your browser. Social network We use Discourse, a free, open source social network which is hosted at https://twu.discourse.group/ (bookmark this page). (Requires separate account registration) Course forums Course forums are used for discussions. The LDRS101 forums are hosted on Discourse. Web site annotations We use Hypothes.is, an open source web-service that enables users to annotate, discuss and share reflections on web site pages on the Internet. (Requires separate account registration) Course blog The course blog is used to share the outputs of your learning. Learners are invited to establish their own personal course blog, for example WordPress.com or Blogger.com. In this way you will retain control over your own data even when the course is finished. (Requires separate account registration) Course feed The Course feed is a unique feature of OERu courses. Course comments and posts tagged with the course code (LiDA101) on the course forums, your course blog, the resource bank, our social network and Hypothes.is will be harvested and incorporated into the live course feed. This is the hub for keeping track of the distributed course interactions on the web. Course resource bank The resource bank is a site used to share web links and summaries of useful resources you find online. We encourage learners to share links publicly with your peers. Remember to vote for links you find useful on the site. Search using the course tag: “LDRS101” Zoom Zoom is a communications platform that allows you to connect via video, audio, phone, or chat. Note the GX Live sessions may use Zoom for the Learning Lab sessions. GX Prime students are encouraged to take advantage of the Learning Hub, which will have weekly Zoom meetings as well. (Requires separate account registration) Learn by doing Some learners will be familiar with these technologies, while others will be using them for the first time. We use a learn by doing approach and you will be prompted in the course materials when to interact with these different technologies. Initially the use of different technologies distributed on the web may be confusing. However, this is a course about learning on the Internet and once you have completed LiDA, you will become a competent user of these online technologies. Have fun and enjoy the learning experience.

This course will introduce you to some ideas related to living, learning, and working in our digitally-saturated society. It is our intent to provide you with opportunities to start your university career with an emerging set of skills and literacies related to digital tools for learning. Within your academic pursuits, you will encounter a vast amount of information, and integrating digital tools into your learning journey might be difficult. Your chosen discipline will provide ample learning possibilities, and incorporating digital tools to enhance your learning may prove challenging. This course will give you a head start on using digital tools to build a workflow that will allow you to stay organized and to make your process of learning visible for yourself and your instructors. We will also lead you through readings and thoughts about your digital identity, privacy and security, and sharing your new knowledge in ethical ways. There will be two primary branches of the course and the tools that we will show you. The first branch will be a workflow that is private to you because it takes place primarily on your own computer, and the second branch is shared as publicly as you are comfortable sharing. You will have control over how public your work is, but we will think about the importance of sharing knowledge and how to do that easily and in ways that preserve your ‘ownership’ over your work. During this first week, there will be both theoretical and practical work for you to do. In order to build a theoretical understanding of digital tools for learning, we will explore the idea of the digital in the context of contemporary society. At the same time, there are some important practicalites to manage in order to get set up for the course, so we will lead you through installing some apps on your computer that you will use extensively in this course, and which hopefully will become the backbone of your digital workflow throughout your time in higher education and beyond. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Understanding the Digital Starting your Workflow Digital Literacies Digital Privacy and safety Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit, you should be able to: Describe your engagement with digital technology Apply digital tools to support learning in an academic environment Explain what digital literacies mean for you in an academic and professional context Examine your digital footprint Build your professional online biography Examine privacy concerns related to various platforms and tools Describe how to protect yourself and others in the digital environment. Activity Checklist Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit. You may find it useful for planning your work. During this unit you will: create a Visitors and Residents diagram download and install Obsidian download and open the course vault in Obsidian activate the plugins that came with the Obsidian vault You will be directed to complete these activities as they come. Assessment See the Assessment section in Moodle for assignment details and due dates. Resources All resources will be provided online in the unit. 1.1 Understanding the Digital We begin Unit 1 with an introduction to the idea of the digital. You may recognize that digital tools are deeply embedded in modern society. It is not uncommon for people of all ages to interact with apps and tools that claim to connect people in conversations or networks, or to perform complex tasks for work, or to control various systems in our vehicles. Digital technology is really everywhere we look. Thinking about these tools is one way to conceptualize how we interact with digital tools, but we can also recognize that our social practices and norms have been impacted by digital tools. An example of this, at least in North America, is that the names of companies have become verbs. If people want to learn something about a topic, they Google it. It is deeper than that, though, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to many jurisdictions relying on mobile phones for allowing people to confirm their vaccination status in order to access restaurants or other public venues in the midst of restrictions creating barriers for those who don’t have mobile phones. Mobile phones are often essential tools for communication, social media, internet browsing, messaging, entertainment, photography, navigation, online shopping, mobile banking, productivity, and health and fitness management. In other cases, such as in social media, it is almost impossible to participate in public discourse without access to technology. Modern universities are also deeply impacted by the digital. Every system involved in higher education has been digitized in some manner, including recruitment, accounting, and fundraising. As you begin your university career, here are some digital systems you will likely encounter: courses are designed and often delivered digitally, course logistics (discussion forums, assignment submissions, quizzes, gradebooks) happen in large digital tools called learning management systems (LMS) or virtual learning environments (VLE) (e.g. Moodle), assignments must often be created digitally (word processors, presentation software, video editors, website builders), research data is gathered, stored, analyzed, and shared digitally There are many other processes and procedures that rely on the digital in higher education, but the important thing for you to realize as you begin your higher education journey is that there are many tools that you will be required to learn and use throughout your journey. Some are more obvious, like word processors, presentation software, email, the library website, and LMSs, but some are less obvious and won’t necessarily be taught specifically, other than in this course. Some of the digital tools we will introduce to you will help you build a workflow for you to manage the huge amount of information and resources that you will have to sort through to complete many of your assignments. You will learn to use AI to find relevant resources on whatever your topic might be. As you know from searching Google, a simple search of the web can turn up thousands or millions of hits, but there are tools that can help you highlight the 20 most relevant resources in just a few clicks. Once you find resources, we will show you tools that will allow you to track all your references, create citations in your writing quickly and easily, and then create a perfectly formatted reference list. Do not waste your time creating your own bibliographies! This one tool will save you days and likely weeks of work during your degree (quite literally). We will show you another tool that will allow you to make connections between ideas and notes so that you build a network of connected ideas. Curating this network of ideas is possibly one of the most useful things you can do in higher ed. You will end up with a searchable network of everything you’ve learned, and be able to visualize it at the click of a button. We will help you think through the implications of how you present yourself on the web so that you can make wise decisions about what you share and how you share it. We will also help you make connections on the web that could become a key resource for your learning and working in your career. Activity Head over to the Learning Hub, which is an app called Discourse that we use to build community among learners who do not attend one of the TWU campuses in Langley or Richmond, BC. Find the Leadership/Media and Communications 101 category and respond to the Welcome forum. 1.2 Digital Literacies Definition 1.1 (Digital Literacy) Digital literacy is a person’s knowledge, skills, and abilities for using digital tools ethically, effectively, and within a variety of contexts in order to access, interpret, and evaluate information, as well as to create, construct new knowledge, and communicate with others. (digitallearningadvisorycommitteePostSecondaryDigitalLearning2022?) Literacy, as we commonly understand it, is the ability to understand the meaning of texts. It is more than just being able to ‘read’. In the same way, digital literacy is the ability to make meaning using digital tools. It is more than simply being able to post to Instagram or TikTok, or whatever app you might use. As the definition above indicates, digital literacy involves using tools ethically, to access, interpret, evaluate, create, construct, and communicate information and knowledge. “In today’s world, being literate requires much, much more than the traditional literacy of yesterday.” —Rebecca Alber Traditionally, literacy was about speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literacy has taken on a much broader and complex meaning. Today there’s also digital literacy, media literacy, new literacy etc. In this signpost you are invited to reflect on how your literacies have changed, when compared to your parents and to speculate on new literacies the next generation of learners may need for the future. Activity Install Obsidian Obsidian is a free note-taking and mind-mapping app. Go to obsidian.md and follow these instructions to install Obsidian on your computer. It is recommended that you use a computer, rather than a mobile phone to install Obsidian, but please let your instructor or facilitator know if you are on mobile. You do NOT need to purchase any upgrades such as Obsidian Sync or Obsidian Publish. Work through the Getting Started section of the Obsidian help pages starting with Create a vault. When you create the vault in this step, we recommend that you name it TWU or something similar. Later, you can create as many vaults as you would like. It is recommended that you use one of the sync services listed here so that your files are backed up. Obsidian will become a backbone of this course as we will use it to learn how the web works and give you a workflow that will help you stay organized. One of the advantages of Obsidian is that everything you do in the app happens on your own computer, rather than the cloud, which is just another way of saying someone else’s computer. However, the drawback to that is that you need to ensure that you have a backup of your vaults in a secure location, either one of the sync services mentioned in step 3, above, or another backup system. Please check the Learning Hub or talk your your instructor or facilitator for help with this. To give you a head start, we have created a starter vault for you to download and use. Follow the instructions below to access the starter vault. Download the Starter Vault Click this link to download the vault. This will download a file called ldrs101-vault-main.zip to your computer. Move the file to your Documents folder. Unzip or extract the contents of the file. Rename the folder to ldrs101. Open the Obsidian app and click the Open another vault icon in the bottom left corner. Choose the ldrs101 folder, and then Obsidian will ask you to trust this vault. Click ‘Trust author and enable plugins’. Once you are in the vault, feel free to take a look around. You will notice a HOME page, a Tools folder with some files in it, and a VR Diagram Canvas. Activity Reflection on the 21st century learner The following video, published by the MacArthur Foundation, questions how digital media are changing the way young people learn, play, socialize, and participate in civic life. John Seely Brown a researcher with particular interests in radical innovation and digital culture suggests that today’s gaming oriented children want to be measured and feel that if they are not learning, it is not fun. How does this relate to how you feel about learning? Watch the video and think about: What “literacy” skills have you acquired when compared to your parents? What “literacy” skills will be important for future learners in higher education? Reflect on the following writing prompts: My parents did not need to … A new literacy I acquired is the ability to … Higher education students of the future will need to … … is an important 21st century skill for future employment To complete this activity, click ‘Open Today’s Daily Note’ in your Obsidian vault and write your reflections. Feel free to add images and other media! Please make sure you add tags to your note. Suggested tags might be #digital-literacy #ldrs101 #macarthur-foundation #john-seely-brown. Notice that tags start with a hashtag and contain no spaces. Separate words with a hyphen. One way to start thinking about digital literacy is to create a map of the apps and tools that you use, how you use them, and what traces of your presence you leave behind on the web. We call this a Visitors and Residents Diagram. To complete this activity, you will need to do a little bit of setup, as follows. 1.2.1 Visitors and Residents It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital ‘natives’ and ‘immigrants’. Note Marc Prensky, who proposed this idea, is the one who thought it would be a good idea to refer to people as ‘natives’. We recognize that this term should not be used to talk about people. The essential argument is that kids these days have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the kids. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky’s original article. Digital native Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task. I’d like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a visitor in some web spaces and a resident in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don’t leave a public trace of your time there. You don’t spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving. Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where you reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it’s a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else’s blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially present. At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;–&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;–&gt; professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use. The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins). Link to YouTube I’ve shared my VR Diagram below…keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there. It is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don’t spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five). For many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn’t determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions. If you don’t already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called Teaching in Higher Ed by Bonni Stachowiak, or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents. Digital Visitors and Residents, with David White - Teaching in Higher Ed Read the following blog post which I believe provides a fitting summary of this particular unit. Technology is not Pedagogy Activity Visitor and Resident Diagram I hope this activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with learners. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? What about the learners in your classes? ✔️ Read Visitors and Residents: A new typology for online engagement ✔️ Create a new ‘Canvas’ in your Obsidian vault and create your own Visitor/Resident map. We have created a sample VR Diagram in the vault. 1.3 Digital Privacy &amp; Safety Now that you have assessed some of your digital skills or literacies, let’s focus our attention on privacy and safety. In this section we summarize important practices as a reminder to remain vigilant in protecting your privacy and security online. If you are unsure about good security practices, there are a wealth of online resources you can (and should) consult. Privacy Your privacy is fragile, easy to lose instantaneously, and difficult to retrieve in an environment that requires so much online interaction. Identity theft happens, frequently. Never put your social security number, your birthday, your mother’s maiden name, or any other personal facts, anywhere online. Everyone on the Internet will be able to access this information. Always assume that anything you write online (including email) can, and probably will, eventually leak. Keep your email address private – to avoid receiving spam. If your email is published in a plain form anywhere online, even if it is part of an archived email list, spammers will “harvest” it for their databases. Spam email (at least half of all email being sent) – is an unfortunate fact of our modern lives. If you must publish your email address online, consider creating a “sacrificial” email address, or one you only use to publish online. You can create an email “alias,” which you can set to automatically forward to your primary email, and easily disable if your spam volumes increases. Many email services will automatically generate random email addresses that you can use to hide your true address. Another approach is to avoid publishing the email address as something like myname@somewebdomain.net… Instead you might use more confusing text, such as myname-at-somewebdomain-net. Some websites support using these types of obfuscation methods, but the spammers who “scrape” email addresses from websites to populate their spam databases use increasingly sophisticated methods to defeat these methods. Basically, avoid publishing the email addresses you value online to decrease the amount of spam you receive. Passwords What about passwords? Many people have just one, or maybe a few. Given the number of websites and web services which require password-based authentication, this is not good enough to avoid an identity disaster. The problem with having only a few passwords is that even resource-rich and security-critical organizations have suffered massive leaks. If even one of them suffers a data leak, identity thieves will obtain your password and try to use it on other websites. It is easy for them to do this using computer technologies. Other ways someone can get your password include: Sniffing traffic when you log into a non-secure website that uses http:// rather than https:// – the “s” stands for secure because your data transmission’s encrypted. Look for the Lock icon.png in your address bar. Sniffing emails – your email, unless encrypted, is not secure. Never send a login and password along with the web address of a service (similarly, don’t send credit card numbers). Phishing attacks – where someone sends you an email that looks like it is from a trusted sender, such as from a friend, your bank, an online store you frequent, or a government agency, and they ask you to enter your password to confirm it. No one should ever ask you to enter your password via email. Always check the web address (hover over the link) to make sure it corresponds to the right place, or call the sender to confirm the request over the phone. Brute force – hackers often use computers to guess your password, beginning with a list of common passwords, and try different combinations until they get it right, or until the system locks them out for trying too many times. “How secure is my password” sites – you should avoid these sites and never type your password into a website or email response that is not appropriate, especially when you know the sender also knows your email. Once your email and any password combination are known, identity thieves will try to use them at various websites, because they know most people only use a few passwords. A thief who discovers a password you created for a website you rarely use will try to compromise the security of a website that is important to you – such as your email system, your workplace, social media accounts, or bank account. Here is a table that shows how quickly passwords can be cracked using brute force methods. Note that the best passwords are both long and include a mix of numbers, lower-case and upper-case letters, and symbols. There are services you can use to check if your email is part of a leaked password data set. So, what can you do to protect yourself? Password Managers Get a password manager. They are incredibly helpful and convenient now that many of us use several computers and mobile devices. Password managers help you manage your passwords. When you choose a password manager, make sure you create one strong password, such as a full sentence with some numbers and special characters. This is all you need to remember – the password manager remembers the others. The ensures you generate a different, fully-random password for each website you use that requires a password. Good password managers only ever store your details in an encrypted form, where even the company that stores it cannot see your passwords. To access your passwords, you log into the password manager service using your single, strong password (via a secure web link – usually the default, but always check!). There are many password manager options. Some widely used proprietary options include Lastpass and 1password. Open source options also exist, such as Bitwarden. Sadly, some of the most popular password managers have suffered from software bugs that have exposed user passwords. Activity: Get a Password Manager If you don’t already use a password manager, set up an account with Lastpass, 1password, or the free password manager, Bitwarden to familiarize yourself with how password managers work. Read the instructions in the article: “How to Start Using a Password Manager” published by Makeuseof.com Create an account on the password manager site and establish a Master Password. (Conduct an online search for advice on choosing a secure Master Password.) Install the browser extension for your local browser. Choose one of the TWU course websites and set up a new secure password using your password manager. Log out of the TWU course website, and log in again using the password manager. Install the mobile phone app for your operating system, and/or desktop application for your computer (optional). Synchronize the local app with your online vault. Consider using the Password manager for your online accounts so you can easily set up and maintain a unique password for each online account you use. Good Messaging Hygiene Always assume that anyone can and will read anything you write in an email. Email is not a secure form of communication. Few people encrypt their email, because it is an extra step that even the most technically-inclined users are reluctant to take. Both sender and recipient have to be technically proficient. Text messages and instant messaging, such as Facebook messenger, are also insecure. Anyone, including government officials and the organization that runs the service, such as Facebook employees, can read it. Secure your Own Privacy Never send any sensitive data, such as your social security number, credit card number, password, or other personal information via email or text. Call the person to provide this information over the phone. You can use a secure, encrypted, text message service, such as Signal if necessary. It is available at no cost, works on most platforms, and encrypts text messages on your phone. If you text someone else with Signal installed, the entire transaction is encrypted. Secure the Privacy of Others Another element of good digital hygiene is to protect the identity of others. For example, never send group emails using To: or CC: (carbon copy) for each email address. You will reveal the email addresses for everyone on your list. This is especially problematic if you or another person saves the email message and displays it on the web, such as in a mailing list archive. This makes it easy for spammers and hackers to access and download all of those email addresses. Use BCC: (blind carbon copy), to hide the email addresses from your recipients, to protect everyone’s privacy. Use your own email address, and BCC the rest of the recipients, if your email software requires you to insert an email address into the To: box. When using an email mailing list, where you send messages to a single email address to a list of people, never CC: someone else in the same message. This will compromise the privacy of every CC’d recipient and the privacy of the list. Always check with the people on the list to ensure you are not taking unacceptable liberties. If someone asks you to share an email address of a friend or colleague, you should ask permission to share their email address, and state why the third party is requesting their email. Be a Thoughtful Sceptic So how can we protect ourselves if new threats are emerging all the time? Be conscious of where you put information that is “private” to you. Beware of the terms of service of social media providers, such as Facebook. Use a service like “TOSDR” to help identify risky, overreaching services. You may be able to use certain privacy settings to protect your information. Always check the identity of a website before you enter any passwords or personal information. Secure certificates are generally trustworthy, but be sure check the names and details. Always ask whether you should trust a provider or a government agency. Always ask “who benefits when I do this?” What are their incentives? Protect your own data and be even more protective of others’ private information. For example, be cautious before posting information about yourself or someone else. Be especially cautious when posting pictures or videos of their children. Remember, complacency and unwarranted trust are your biggest enemies. A healthy paranoia is good for your digital health. Think about the great amount of time and effort it will take to regain your identity (and credit rating) if your information is compromised. Activity: ToS Analysis Use the Terms of Service: Didn’t Read site to look up each of the apps we will learn in this course. Each tool currently has it’s own file in your Obsidian vault with a template ready to go for you. Fill out the template for each tool based on what is available on tosdr.org and your own exampination of the ToS for each tool. Feel free to add components to the template. Activity: Blog: Digital Literacies for Online Learning Publish a blog post responding to four requirements: Your personal definition of digital literacies justified from your reading of the literature (about 100 to 150 words) Describe what digital literacies mean for you in a sentence. Create a link to your VR diagram map in your entry. Summarise an action plan for improving your digital literacies.

In previous units, you’ve been introduced to the world of digital literacies and how to use various tools for organizing and connecting ideas. You have started to build a workflow to help you learn more effectively, and have applied the critical skill of metacognition to explain your process for learning. Now, let’s delve into the next phase of our learning journey. In the second half of the course, you will continue to build your digital skills and apply critical thinking to document your learning process. Our focus will shift from creating a personal collection of ideas to presenting your learning in a more open platform. It’s important to emphasize that you will decide how public you want to be. We’ll also consider why sharing knowledge is important and explore user-friendly ways to do so while still maintaining your control over your work and handling privacy matters. As you begin this unit, reflect on your personal and academic goals as they relate to digital literacy. Consider which digital tools you’d like to explore and reflect on how your online contributions can not only benefit you, but also make a positive impact on others. Topics This unit is divided into the following topics: Personal Learning Environments Building a Learning Blog My Digital Footprint Evaluating Digital Tools Learning Outcomes When you have completed this unit, you should be able to: Create a personalized narrative to document and express your learning process Examine your digital footprint and develop a positive digital online identity Evaluate digital tools, platforms, and interactions based on ethical principles Critically evaluate the affordances and restraints of digital tools and platforms Identify the digital skills needed in your field of study Describe how to protect yourself, other students and colleagues, to stay safe in the digital environment Practice evaluative judgment to document your process of learning in complex domains of knowledge Activity Checklist Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit. You may find it useful for planning your work. Learning Activities Reflect on your Personal Learning Enviroment as you view the resources on PLEs. Create a new blog on WordPress and personalise your blog site. Conduct a Digital Footprint Audit Document and share your learning experience by posting a blog entry. Evaluate a digital tool, considering the ethical implications Read the artical on Digital Wisdom, and reflect on how we use technology for our own benefit and to benefit others. Note: The learning activities in this course are designed to prepare you for the graded assigments in this course. You are strongly encouraged to complete them. Assessment Assignment 2: Digital Citizenship Blog See the Assessment section in Moodle for assignment details. Resources All resources will be provided online in the unit. Resource Reminders Don’t forget to add resources to your Zotero library that align with your individual learning path. Remember, your fellow students are a valuable resource! Engage with your online community for assistance, and don’t hesitate to exchange helpful resources and valuable insights. 4.1 Personal Learning Environments The primary purpose of this topic is to enable you to set up your own Learning Blog, which will form the hub of your Personal Learning Environment (PLE). Blog posts are a useful way of reflecting on your learning and a means to network with your peers. It also provides our TWU learning community with a way to see how you are engaging with the course and to help where we can. The purpose of a PLE is to put the learner at the centre of the online learning environment, which will be enabled by establishing a personal blog for this course. So what is a Personal Learning Environment? ‘Personal Learning Environments are systems that help learners take control of and manage their own learning. This includes providing support for learners to set their own learning goals, manage their learning; managing both content and process, communicate with others in the process of learning, and thereby achieve learning goals. A PLE may be composed of one or more sub-systems: As such it may be a desktop application, or composed of one or more web-based services.’ PLE Wiki A Personal Learning Environment is “a structure and process that helps learners organize the influx of information, resources and interactions that they are faced with on a daily basis into a personalized learning space or experience. In a PLE, the learner develops an individualized digital identity through the perceptual cues and cognitive affordances that the personal learning environment provides, such as what information to share and when, who to share it with, and how to effectively merge formal and informal learning experiences (Castañeda, Cosgrave, Marín, Cronin, 2016) cited in Personal Learning Environments: Research-Based Practices, Frameworks and Challenges. What elements of the two definitions resonate with you? How do you organize your daily interations and influx of information? How do you share your learning with others? What are your learning goals? Activity: What is a PLE? Before you start building your PLE, read the following article: “7 Things you should know about personal learning environments” Questions to Consider After reading the article, consider the following: How do PLEs promote authentic, student-centred learning? What are the benefits of a PLE? How would it benefit you? What tools do you currently use as part of your learning environment? Finally, consider the approach taken at TWU as it supports inquiry-rich learning. As you watch the short video below, think about how you could use your PLE to enrich your learning at TWU. Watch: Inquiry-Rich Learning 4.2 Building a Learning Blog In the next activity, you will gain first hand experience in using blog technology for publishing your own website. You will “declare” yourself online using your PLE (as an alternative to posting an introduction in a closed course forum typically used in a conventional online course). Note that TWU online courses often use Moodle Discussion Forums to facilitate conversations. By using a platform such as Wordpress, you can retain the contents of your posts, as well as the comments of your peers. In an LMS (Learning Management System) such as Moodle, you may lose access to what you have posted in discussions, and more importantly, conversations with your peers. As you create your personal blog in WordPress (or your own selective blog site), you control your data and who can see it. You will retain control of your data and learning outputs generated during this online course, even after the course is completed. You get to choose: The blog service you would like to use, although we recommend WordPress as it is supported by TWU. Whether to accept comments on your blog from your peers Whether to register your blog for the aggregated course feed so that any posts tagged with the course code (LDRS101) will be harvested for the feed. A key teaching philosophy of this course is to embed the acquisition of new digital literacies into your learning journey. Knowledge of how to use the Internet and social media technologies will better prepare you for life in a digital world. If this is your first time blogging, you should spend time in setting up your personal digital learning environment. Please remember that your Learning Blog and the social media technologies you use on this course are public, and that you take full responsibility for anything you publish. Do not disclose any confidential information and respect the privacy of others. In short, don’t say anything that you would not want to read on the Internet. Activity: Setting Up Your Learning Blog As this is a course focusing on digital literacies, you are asked to establish a Learning Blog, as this will improve your skills and enable you to network with your peers. We recommend using WordPress, as it is supported by TWU. WordPress is an open source website builder and is one of the most popular systems out there because of its versatility. If you already have your own website or you have previous experience using WordPress, you may set up your blog on it and skip the set-up steps described below, but you still need to complete the learning activities. We are here to help you create your site, so do not hesitate to ask for technical support. Below you will find a number of resources, but if you get stuck, please reach out on Discourse, or email elearning@twu.ca To get started on creating your site we suggest the following steps: 1. Sign up to create a website Go to create.twu.ca to sign up for your free WordPress site. Please read all the prompts and instructions carefully! Be sure to read the Privacy Statement carefully before clicking “I Agree.” The information provided gives you excellent guidance regarding digital citizenship, privacy, and how to build a professional digital persona. You will be prompted to create a domain name, which is your website’s address on the Internet. Often this is referred to as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). This is what your users will type in their browsers to reach your site. Make sure that you choose a domain name that is related to you, easy to pronounce and spell, and easy to remember. Once you have done that, we suggest you write all this information somewhere you can access it easily – just in case. You will also be asked to select a theme for your website. You are free to choose any template you wish. TWU Spark, TWU Hope, and TWU Spartans portfolio are simple to set up and provide easy navigation. When you choose your theme, your new site will come with a simple menu and instructions for portfolio and website creation. When you have activated your site (look for a notification in your TWU email), then you are ready to create. 2. Explore your dashboard The dashboard is the initial area you see when you log in to TWU Create. It’s the centre for your site management and where you create content. From the Dashboard you can navigate to content, settings, themes, plugins, and more. When logged in to TWU Create, you will always have access to an admin menu visible on your sites. From the menu item that is the name of the blog (second from left), you can find the link to the dashboard. While in the dashboard, the same menu can be used to return to the front view of your site. Determine the difference between the dashboard used for editing and the published view of your blog. (It is important to know the difference because, when you register your blog for the course feed, you must use the url for the public view of your blog). Progress check: - Do you know how to open the published (public view) of your blog in a new window? - Have you added a browser bookmark to your dashboard and public version of your blog? Help Tips: When you are in the site administration area of your site, you can get tips on what you are doing by clicking the “Help” menu on the top-right corner. Click on “Help” and read through the Overview describing the elements of the dashboard. insert - Animation showing location of WordPress help tab - from https://create.twu.ca/eportfolios/wordpress/ 3. Review your settings Review and customise your blog settings from the dashboard according to your preferences. Enable Categories and Tags We recommend that you enable categories and tags on your blog. Categories are best used for broad groupings of topics. For example, if you’re creating a site that reviews pop culture, you might use categories such as Books, Film, and TV. Tags are more specific keywords that you want to use to associate related content. For example, if you were creating a site that reviews pop culture, you might want to use tags such as science fiction, horror, and action adventure. You can combine the two! For our review site example, you might be reviewing a romantic comedy. You can assign the broader category Film to the post, then give it some more specific tags such as romantic comedy, or even use the name of the actors and director as tags. People who view that post could use the tags to find related posts around that topic. Set up Comments Settings (Optional) WordPress comes with a built-in comment system allowing your users to leave comments on your posts. This comment system is great for user engagement, but it can also be targeted by spammers as well. If you don’t want comments on your posts, then ensure that the ‘Allow comments’ box is unchecked at the bottom of the editor page. If you do want comments, but want to manage the spam, you’ll need to enable comment moderation on your website. Visit Settings » Discussions page and scroll down to ‘Before a comment appears’ section. Check the box next to ‘Comment must be manually approved’ option. 4. Personalise your blog Visit the appearance option on your dashboard and personalise your blog by: - Changing your theme, header image, background colours and/or image - Add at least one widget to your blog. Remember — “less is more“. One or two of the following are functional choices: Archives, recent posts, categories or category cloud, and blogs I follow. You need to hit the “Save” button to save your changes. 5. Add a page &amp; a post Pages and posts are where the content is housed on WordPress. The biggest difference between the two is that posts are timestamped, whereas pages are timeless. Pages are for static content. They do not need a publish date. Use pages you want your visitors to always be able to see that content in that spot, no matter when they visit. Posts are for timely content. They have a publish date, and they are displayed with the newest content at the top (reverse chronological order) of your site’s blog page. Older posts can “fall off” the blog page (the content is still kept, but no longer visible). Posts are what you should think of when you hear the term “blog post.” Usually posts have a comment section, and this is where viewers can write a comment in response to your post. This may be a handy way to receive feedback from your peers. Also, you can categorize or tag your posts, which is useful to help readers locate posts on your blog. To add a new Page or Post, click the Pages or Posts menu option and then click the Add New link underneath. Another way is to hover your cursor over Pages or Posts and click the Add new link in the fly-out menu. BLOG CHALLENGE! Edit a Page: Complete your personal details for display on the “About” page of your blog. - Progress check: Can you see the updates on your “about” page in the published view of your blog? Edit a Blog Post: Reflect on your experience of this activity on creating a blog. Click on “save draft” (so you can review before publishing live on the web). Your reflection could for example: - Introduce yourself and reflect on what you would like to achieve by maintaining a blog to support your learning - Reflect on what you thought of the activity; Was it easy or hard? - Share links to any additional resources you found useful in completing the tasks. - Provide tips for future learners who will be completing this activity. If you were to set up a new blog again, what would you do differently? - Add anything your readers may find interesting or useful. 6. Add media Using different types of media to represent your artifacts is a great way to make your portfolio dynamic and keep your audience engaged. Text-heavy pages can get cumbersome regardless of how you arrange it. Media can help with breaking up content or replacing text all together. Consider how you can “show what you know” rather than just simply telling. Media can also be an alternative to simply hyperlinking all your artifacts. Instead of sending your audience off to another site or tab, media can be embedded (see Media Library) to keep your audience contained to your page. The Media Library on your WordPress site houses the media you upload to your site. WordPress supports a variety of media types such as images, audio, video, and documents. We do suggest that you host your video files in your TWU Microsoft Stream account for optimal playability. Other types of media are typically uploaded and inserted into the text editor when writing a post or page. BLOG PHOTO CHALLENGE! Choose a photo to add to your blog post. - Be sure you have permission to upload the photo. We suggest using an open licence site, such as Pixabay, Unsplash, Pexels, Wikimedia Commons, or Flickr. - Alternatively, upload your own photo, take a selfie or ask someone to take a photo of you working on this blog post challenge. BLOG VIDEO CHALLENGE! (Optional) You may find as you continue the course that you want to share videos you find on the web, or perhaps even your own! If you’re up for the challenge, consider recording a short video introduction and embed this in your blog post. Here is a tutorial on how to add a Youtube video or embed one of your own videos to your blog: 7. Publish! Review your draft post and, when you’re happy with what you’ve written, click on the “Publish post” button. 7. Share your blog Add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LDRS101 Post in the LDRS 101 Discourse forum to let your peers know the web address of your blog and ask them to post a comment. This will give you the opportunity to experience how comments function on your blog and to test if they are working properly. Additional Customizations When you’re ready to start customizing your blog and putting content in, check out some tutorials available to you: TWU’s Wordpress Support Page TWU’s Wordpress Video Tutorials - new sharepoint address? WordPress Support Website Beginner’s guide for WordPress by WPBeginner WordPress Tutorials from University of Victoria If you are confused about anything it is always good to do an initial Google or YouTube search, reach out on Discourse, or email elearning@twu.ca Congratulations!! You created your PLE for TWU! 4.3 My Digital Footprint Now that you have created your Learning Blog and introduced yourself online, let’s take a closer look at the information about you available on the internet. Imagine if potential employers were to search for you online. What would they discover, and what would you prefer them to find? As we examine online identities in this topic, we will ask you to consider how you can improve your digital identity in support of your online learning, as well as future employment prospects. First, let’s clarify some key terms. We need to distinguish between the technical and human elements of online identity. In this course, we are more interested in the human side of online identity, but in part, this is determined by how technology automates the process of building your digital footprint. Digital identity refers to the information utilized by computer systems to represent external entities, including a person, organization, application, or device. When used to describe an individual, it encompasses a person’s compiled information and plays a crucial role in automating access to computer-based services, verifying identity online, and enabling computers to mediate relationships between entities. Digital identity for individuals is an aspect of a person’s social identity and can also be referred to as online identity. (Wikipedia: Online). Digital footprint or digital shadow refers to one’s unique set of traceable digital activities, actions, contributions, and communications manifested on the Internet or digital devices. Digital footprints can be classified as either passive or active. The former is composed of a user’s web-browsing activity and information stored as cookies. The latter is often released deliberately by a user to share information on websites or social media. While the term usually applies to a person, a digital footprint can also refer to a business, organization or corporation. (Wikipedia:Online). Activity: What is a Digital Footprint? Watch the following video and consider the steps you would take to control your digital footprint. Activity: Who am I Online…and Why Should I Care? Read the following articles: Understanding your Online Identity. How To Manage Your Digital Footprint: 20 Tips for Students Questions to Consider Consider the following questions: How does your real-world identity differ from your online identity? What factors inhibit or support the sharing of information in building an online identity? What is the value of an online identity for learning? Reminder: As you view online resources in this course, feel free to annotate and discuss web resources publicly in support of your learning. (Digital Tools: Hypothes.is, Discourse, WordPress, etc.) In addition to evaluating who you are online, ask yourself, “Why Should I Care?” First, watch the following video, Four Reasons to Care About Your Digital Footprint Next, select from these resources to inform your views: Students turn to Internet to build online presence, showcase work, published on Huffingtonpost. Your Online Presence published by the Open University 10 Ways to Build your Online Identity UBC’s Digital Tattoo project Policy Brief: Privacy from the Internet Society Finally, consider how much someone could find out about you from your digital footprints. Here’s an interesting video that might cause you to reconsider what you post online. Activity: Digital Footprint Audit In this activity you will audit your own digital footprint in order to find out what exists on the internet about you, and reflect on what you want your online identity to be. Follow the steps below to begin. Conduct a Google search of your own name (using an incognito or private window in Chrome or Firefox). Search for your first name and surname without parenthesis (for example: snow white) and then with parenthesis (for example: “snow white”). Explore the results of your search. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of current and previous employers. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of previous schools you attended. Expand your search to include social media sites, for example: “snow white” twitter; “snow white” facebook; “snow white” youtube etc. Note any interesting or surprising findings. Activity: Blog: My Digital Footprint Prepare and publish a short blog post of about 250 to 300 words focusing on what you hope to achieve with your online digital identity for learning. Your post can include: Reflection: Share your thoughts on the outcomes of your footprint audit. Remember that your blog post is public, so only share what you are comfortable sharing with the world. You don’t need to be specific; for example, you can generalise: “I am satisfied with my digital footprint because …” or “I would like to improve my digital footprint for learning because …” Professional versus private: Consider how you want to separate your “private” online identity from your professional and / or learning identity. If you already maintain an online presence (existing blog or social media accounts) think about how you will separate professional / learning posts from private and social life interactions online. For example, maintaining a separate course or learning blog is one way to achieve this distinction. Will you link your personal online identities (e.g. an existing X (formerly Twitter) username or Facebook account) with your learning blog? Will you link your professional online identity (e.g. published online biography or resume) with your learning blog? Objectives: List a few objectives for developing or improving your online identity. Tag: Add a category or tag to your post using the course tag: LDRS101 (This is needed to harvest links to posts from registered blogs for the course feed.) Remember: You are in charge of what you post online and you decide what you would like to share for your digital identity for the purposes of this course. Don’t share high risk personal details like physical address, date of birth, name of first pet, etc., which may make it easier for identity thieves to appear more credible. If unsure, consult online resources for internet safety; for example Get Cyber Safe from the government of Canada. 4.4 Evaluating Online Tools So far in Unit 4, you have created a Learning Blog in WordPress, explored your social media platforms, and used a range of other tools like Zotero, Hypothes.is, Discourse, Obsidian, and more. As we step into this new topic, we encourage you to engage in a critical examination of the online tools you use or are interested in. Beyond the basic considerations of functionality and user-friendliness, we invite you to assess digital tools, platforms, and interactions through the lens of ethical principles. So how do we evaluate technology on ethical principles? Here are some guiding questions from Ethical EdTech: Guiding Questions Where does power lie, and where are we expected to place our trust? To whom is it accessible—for instance, in terms of usability and cost? Does it lock us into closed, commercial systems or invite us into open communities? Does it give us more control over the learning process, or does it cede that control? Does it respect and protect our privacy appropriately? Can we access, study, and modify the underlying code or design? Who owns the infrastructure and our usage data? Does it produce private profit or public commons? These crucial questions highlight the importance of privacy, data ownership, and accessibility. What other questions would you ask to ensure a tech tool is ethical? Activity: What Are My Criteria? Read the following Rubric for Digital Tool Evaluation. Note there are a number of criteria, some that may not apply to the tool you choose to evaluate. In this activity, create your own criteria for evaluating digital tools. Set up a spreadsheet or notepad (in Obsidian for example) and as you list your criteria, consider why that detail is important to you. To help you select your criteria, read the following: Privacy policy from the Internet Society Ethical EdTech This next website might be a bit of an eye-opener. You may want to browse through some common tech examples and see their score. Terms of service. Didn’t read Finally, read the following questions and consider what you want to add to your rubric considering the context of the tool, the terms of service, and the purpose. Business Context Who owns the tool? Who is the tool maker or CEO? What are their politics? Does that matter? What is the tool’s history? How do they market themselves? How does the company generate revenue? What is their market positioning / point of difference? Who are the competitors? What do others say about the product? Are these sources reliable? Terms of Service What are the terms of service? Are they easy to find? What personal data is required to use the tool (username, real names, email, date of birth etc)? Who owns the data? How is the data protected? Where is the data housed? What flexibility do users have to be anonymous? Does the tool support open licensing of user generated content? How is copyright infringement managed? How is user generated content distributed by the company? What license does the user give the company for distributing to third parties? Can users delete their accounts or leave the service? Can users export their data? What export formats are supported? How is personal information managed? Can information be shared with third parties, and if so under what conditions? Can the company terminate a users account? Under what conditions? How are the changes to the terms of service managed? Fit For Purpose Is the tool suitable for the stated purpose? How does the design of the tool influence what users can do with the tool? Does the tool provide support resources and or help tutorials? Search the web to find out if others provide help and advice on using the tool (for example Youtube, blog posts etc.) What are the implications or opportunities of the tool to support learning in a digital age? Activity: Evaluate a Digital Tool In this challenge, you are invited to critically evaluate an online tool. Step 1: Set Your Goals As you select the tool you want to evaluate, consider your goals for improving your digital skills. What do you want to do or learn online? What skills are needed in your academic area and profession? What tool would be helpful for you and your peers to know more about? Step 2: Choose a Tool Examples of tools: Please select any online tool, or choose one from the list below. Blogging: Blogger, WordPress, Medium, Tumblr File sharing: Dropbox, Nextcloud, MediaFire, Google Drive, SugarSync Presentations: Haikudeck, Prezi, Google Slides, Slides (using Reveal.js) Online collaboration: Basecamp, Slack, Rocket.chat, Hipchat Video conferencing: jitsi, Anymeeting, Zoom, GoToMeeting, Microsoft Teams Feed aggregators: Feedly, Panada, NewsBlur, Inoreader, Feedreader. Project management: Trello, Kanboard, Freedcamp, Asana, Notion, GitHub Step 3: Evaluate the Tool Use your chosen rubric or guiding questions to complete your review Step 4: Share Your Insights! Prepare a blog post (about 450 – 600 words) where you publish a critical review of your selected tool. Your blog post must: State your intended purpose for the tool Highlight strengths and weaknesses (Company reputation, software features, terms of service etc.) Include hyperlinks to appropriate web pages Include references using the APA style if required Include if applicable a disclaimer or disclosure, that is whether you have any association with the company or tool that may impact on the review. Include concluding recommendation(s) Include a comment on whether the tool fit for your stated purpose? Include a comment on whether the extent to which the tool would be useful for learning in a digital age? Add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LDRS101 Optional: On Discourse, let us know what tool you selected and why. Share the link of your review blog. Summary In this unit, you have had the opportunity to learn about your personal learning environment and build your presence on the web using a blog. You’ve examined your digital footprint and reflected on your online identity - what it is now, and where you want it to be. You’ve also had an opportunity to evaluate digital tools and their ethical implications, and consider what tools will help you academically and personally. As you continue with the last two units of the course, we want to encourage you to examine your purpose in using technology, as well as how your contributions online can benefit others.

In its simplest form, citizenship refers to the rights, privileges and duties of being a national citizen. However, the concept of being a good citizen encompasses much more, particularly if you think about full engagement as a member of society. “Citizenship is a status that is bestowed on those who are full members of a community.” -—T.H. Marshall Activity: Reflecting on Digital Citizenship If good citizenship means to fulfill your role as citizen, can you think of five things good citizens do? Consider the following questions: In a digital world, is loyalty to your country a necessary component of the definition of good citizenship? Is education a pre-requisite for good citizenship? In a digital world, what does it mean to be a global citizen? Read the Wikipedia article on Global Citizenship Education where learners engage in solving real world problems. Has the concept of good citizenship changed over time? In what ways? Does citizenship require active community engagement? Read this post by Kristen Mattson, director of a high school library media center: John Dewey Would Hate Your Digital Citizenship Curriculum. Why has the concept digital been linked with citizenship or should we drop the word digital and just talk about good citizenship? Write your thoughts in your Reflective Journal (using Obsidian or WordPress). Conclude by writing down a description of “digital citizenship” in your own words. (You will need this later for the assessment. It does not need to be a scholarly definition – just your personal thoughts on the concept.) Defining Digital Citizenship Defining digital citizenship is not easy because it means different things to different people. It is also a concept which is debated among scholars researching the field. If you conduct a general search for “digital citizenship” you will find many links referencing resources targeting the school-level, with a focus on safe, skilled and ethical use of online technology. While these aspects are important, for the purposes of this tertiary-level course, we need to explore the concept of digital citizenship in more detail. Activity: Podcast on Digital Citizenship In this activity you will listen to a podcast that focuses on the people dimension of digital citizenship. Meet Autumm Caines, associate director of academic technology from the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching at Capital University in a podcast with Bonni Stachowiak. Listen to the first 15–20 minutes of this Teaching in HigherEd podcast on Digital citizenship. The podcast introduces aspects of digital citizenship and the learner experience in starting out with engagement with social media. Listen: Digital Citizenship - with Autumm Caines Guiding framework Autumm Caines provides a useful framework for thinking about digital citizenship Digital identities that is who you are online including the identities of others (individuals and organisations). Digital environments, specifically the tools and online spaces we use to interact with each other. (For example Facebook, Discourse, X, Blogs, Forums etc.). Interactions between these identities and environments. Activity: Refined Definition of Digital Citizenship The purpose of this activity is to explore the elements of digital citizenship with particular emphasis on those relevant to your academic study. Read through the following resources in order to refine your own definition of what it means to be a Digital Citizen. Step 1: Online Search: Read the introductory section of the Wikipedia article: Digital citizen Conduct a general search for “definition of digital citizen.” Choose the two best definitions and add these to the library of your citation management tool (Hypothes.is / Zotero / Obsidian), or keep a record for citation purposes. Try and locate one recent scholarly definition for “digital citizen.” Record the reference for citation purposes. How recent is the reference? Step 2: Social Media Search: Explore the recent tweets (on X or whichever social media app you prefer) using the following hashtags: #digitalcitizenship, #digiciz, and #digicit. Compile a list of elements relating to the concept of digital citizenship. Step 3: Read &amp; Comment: - Login to hypothes.is. - Read Nine elements of digital citizenship by Mike Ribble - Feel free to add or reply to annotations using Hypothes.is. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: #LDRS101 (This is needed to harvest posts for the course feed.) Step 4: Apply the Elements Generate a table listing the nine elements of digital citizenship and identify a practical example of the element for your academic study: For example: Element Academic Study Example Digital access Students from low income countries may not have reliable or affordable access to the Internet. Digital commerce Digital communication Digital literacy Digital etiquette Digital law Digital rights and responsibilities Digital health and wellness Digital security Step 5: Define Digital Citizenship After completing the steps above, revise your personal description of digital citizenship. Does your new definition differ from your initial description? Step 6: Share Your Insights! Share a reflection on this activiy by posting either in your blog or on the Discourse forum. For example: I didn’t realize the … is part of digital citizenship because … … is not particularly relevant for university learners because … … is particularly relevant for university learners because … Rights and Responsibilities The concept of citizenship encompasses the rights and responsibilities of individuals. We need to consider what rights and responsibilities come with digital citizenship. In this mini challenge, we explore this topic with particular emphasis on the rights and responsibilities associated with learning in a digital age. Following the hype of massive open online courses (MOOC) and the New York Times declaring 2012 the “year of the MOOC,“ a small group of educators drafted “A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in a Digital Age.” This document forms the basis for a course discussion on the rights and responsibilities of digital citizens. Activity: Rights &amp; Responsibilities of Digital Citizens Search: Conduct a general search for rights and responsibilities of digital citizenship to assist in refining your own list for university online study. Your search is likely to generate many results developed for the school sector, so you need to evaluate if these rights and responsibilities are appropriate for you. Udacity version of the bill of rights: A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in the Digital Age ‘Bill of Rights’ Seeks to Protect Students’ Interests as Online Learning Rapidly Expands, from the Chronicle of Higher Education. Critique of ‘Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in the Digital Age’ from Inside Higher Ed. Conduct a search through the TWU library for Digital Rights and Responsibilities Remember to annotate and comment on the Hypothes.is and tag your contributions using the course code: #LDRS101 Blog: Prepare a table summarising the primary rights and responsibilities for university learning in a digital age. Discuss: Drawing on your knowledge and experience, please join the discussion on Discourse regarding rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age at TWU. You can discuss the topical issues listed below, or add new ones to the forum. In each case, justify your position taking opposing views into account. Topical Issues Should higher education institutions have the right to determine what software applications learners should use for their studies? Data generated by learners belongs to the learners, therefore should they have the right to access their data (for example forum discussion contributions) even after the course has completed? Should higher education institutions reserve the right to ban disruptive learners from their learning platforms? Where legally permissible, should learners have the right to access all course materials without the need to register a password? Should higher education institutions have the right to limit the time required for completing a course? Others? We encourage you to reply and “like” good posts on Discourse. (Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS101). Personal and Professional Identity In short, digital citizenship is about being a person on the web. In the previous unit on building your online presence, we noted that individuals portray different personas online, for example personal, academic and professional. On the one hand, we need to be careful about what we post online because this can have a negative impact on future career prospects or current employment. We must also be cognisant of the different limitations that different careers place on what can be shared publicly and what needs to stay private. On the other hand, building a strong learning or professional network online is very powerful in staying up to date with new trends and establishing connections with your peers. In this section, we reflect on the balance between public and private in a digital world, recognising that this is going to be different for each person depending on their own environments and professional circumstances. We will also explore how like-minded professionals in your field of interest network online. “The impact exercised by ICTs is due to at least four major transformations: the blurring of the distinction between reality and virtuality; the blurring of the distinction between human, machine and nature; the reversal from information scarcity to information abundance; and the shift from the primacy of stand-alone things, properties, and binary relations, to the primacy of interactions, processes and networks.” —- Luciano Floridi Activity: Professional Online Identity and Digital Citizenship In this activity we will explore professional online identity and networking in the field of your choice. First, scan a few of the following resources: High court rules public servants can be sacked for political social media posts, published by The Guardian. ’Think of social media as a virtual resumé,’ expert warns in light of health board resignation, published by CBC News. You can also search online using the terms “fired over tweet” or “social media firing cases”. Next, watch this short video interview with Alec Couros, published by Teaching and Learning in South Australia. Alec summarises how educators are using twitter to connect professionally. Watch: Using Twitter effectively in education - with Alec Couros Finally, visit the LinkedIn help page on finding and joining a LinkedIn group. Questions to Consider After completing the activities above, answer the following questions: How do like-minded professionals in your career or future career, field, discipline etc. network online (for example X, LinkEdIn groups, other websites?)? What hashtags, if any, are being used for conversations in your chosen field? What are the topical areas of discussion at the moment? How could your field of interest improve professional networking online? Do organisations in your field place restrictions on employees participating in social networks? (See for example Corporate Social Media Policies: The Good, the Mediocre, and the Ugly, and More Social Media Policies: LA Times, Harvard Law, Microsoft, and Cisco.) Activity: Blog: Professional online identity and digital citizenship Prepare a short blog post (about 300 – 400 words) summarising your findings on professional online networking in your field of interest. Consider the following questions: How do like-minded professionals in your field network online and what do they talk about? What does this mean for your online identity and being a digital citizen? Remember to add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: LDRS101. Activity: Blog: My Online Biography In this challenge you are asked to build or update your professional online biography and the “About” page of your course blog. Reflect on the following online personas, target audience and how this will impact on the style and voice of the communication medium. Persona Primary audience Personal Friends and family Professional (Future) Employers and professional network Academic Peer learning network Choose the most appropriate medium for each of your online personas, for example: Persona Medium example Personal Facebook Professional Linkedin Academic Learning blog or website Identify one or two professionals from your field of interest who maintain an active web presence and contribute regularly via social media. Explore their respective websites and professional listings as examples. X (formerly Twitter) is a good place to search for individuals using popular hashtags from your field or area of study, for example “#highereducation”. Click through to their respective X user page. If they have a personal website listed on the user page, visit the site and review their “About” page. Visit their employer’s page and try to locate their biography on the employer’s website. Search for the user on Linkedin Compare the user information on these different sites. Observe how they link to social media accounts, and vary the style and content presented for the different personas. Create or update your professional profile on Linkedin. Consult TWU’s Student Resources website about LinkedIn.) TWU gives you access to LinkedIn Learning, which includes several great courses and videos, such as Rock Your LinkedIn Profile. Create or update your “About” page on your Learning Blog. You may prefer using a more informal style for this page aligned with your own personality and interests. Include links to your professional profile and respective links to social media that you use. Visit the profile pages of your active social media accounts. Update if necessary providing links back to your main page (for example, the “About” page on your website). Think carefully about information you post publicly and keep a clear distinction between your personal online presence and your professional online persona. Review your privacy settings on your personal account(s). 5.2 Online Communities In this section we explore the topic of online communities and how we can engage in social media to enhance our learning. In the early years of the internet, there was a strong research interest in studying the differences between virtual and real communities. However, in more recent years, we have observed a blurring of the boundaries between online and real communities. In The difference between online &amp; real life community? Alison Michalk states: Community boundaries are blurred to the extent that the Internet is nothing more than a conduit for communication. The Internet is now just another tool that we use to communicate within our various communities. The same as we use mail, telephone and even a car to keep in touch with our friends, family and colleagues. Our ‘real life communities’ are not mutually exclusive from our ‘online communities’ given that it all comes down to implied physical presence. (2013, June 27) So how do we join and contribute constructively to these digital communities? If you don’t have much experience with online communities, we enccourage you to participate in the course forums and become an active member of the TWU online learning community. Research on Online Communities Research on the efficacy of online communities provides insights on selecting productive communities and how to engage. Community contributors can be classified into three types (Mocus et al 2002): Core members are responsible for guiding the development of the community and have usually been involved with the community for a long time. These members have made significant contributions to the community’s evolution and have earned leadership status. Frequently they also play an active role in moderation of the group. Active members make regular contributions to the community. Peripheral members occasionally contribute to the discussions and the periods of engagement are short and sporadic. “Lurkers”, that is individuals seeking answers without making contributions, are normally associated with this group. The nature of engagement in a community is influenced by the community’s life cycle stage (A. Iriberri and G. Leroy 2009): Life cycle stage Characteristics Inception stage Focus is on determining the purpose, codes of conduct, funding and sustainability. Creation stage User-centred design and evolution including issues of privacy, anonymity, open versus closed communications. Growth stage Focus is on community building, for example: recruiting members, growth management, integrating new members, trust building, up-to-date content, interaction support, a few offline and online events and meetings. Maturity stage By this stage a community culture will have emerged with identifiable community leaders. Focus shifts to permeated management and control, recognition of contributions, recognition of loyalty, member satisfaction management and subgroup management. Additional factors identified by the research to keep in mind include: Network cohesion, that is the overall level of connections indicated by the network density has a positive impact on the core group as well as the success of the community (Toral et al 2010). Network structure. Successful communities need a critical mass of contributors, however there is no fixed number that determines success. Most communities can expect between 45 – 90% of non-active members, but communities with a strong and experienced core group will have a positive impact on success (Toral et al 2010[3]). Moreover, the positive effects of network structure on participation persist irrespective of the life cycle stage of the community, and activity participation influences network structure (Igl 2014[4]). Centralization. Communities with a high degree of centralisation and control exerts a negative impact on all participation variables. (Igl 2014). Practical implications There are many online communities, and it will be worth your effort in doing a little online research to determine the network cohesion and network structure of the community. You will be able to determine this by reviewing the archive history. Avoid communities with overly centralised control, in the long run, they are not likely to be productive. When joining an online community, try to identify the life cycle stage by scanning the archive of posts. Young communities are likely to be more tolerant of newbie questions, as responses to these questions will provide support resources for new members in the future. It’s a good idea to search the forum for your answer before posting a question. Don’t be surprised if newbie questions go answered in mature communities, they may can even attract curt rebuttals. If you’re a long standing member of the community, post a tactful reply, for example, “Your question has already been answered” and post a link to the appropriate reply. The best advice when joining a new community is to lurk for a while before introducing yourself so that you can become familiar with the culture and practices of the community. Fill out your profile page on the forum site, rather than posting a biography in the main discussion threads. Of course, if the community is in the creation phase, you may want to play a more active role in building the community and becoming part of the core contributors. Communities of Practice As you continue to reflect on your social network and consider other learning networks to join for personal or professional growth, we want to present another framing of an online community called a Community of Practice. A community of practice (CoP) is a group of people who “share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly”. – Wenger, 2014 Cognitive anthropologists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger coined the term “community of practice” when studying apprenticeships as a learning model—the term referred to the community that acts as a living curriculum. Once the concept was articulated the researchers started to see communities everywhere, even when no formal apprenticeship system existed. The basic premise behind communities of practice is simple: we all learn in everyday life from the communities in which we find ourselves. Communities of practice are everywhere. Nearly everyone belongs to some community of practice, whether it is through our working colleagues or associates, our profession or trade, or our leisure interests, such as a book club. Wenger (2000) argues that a community of practice is different from a community of interest or a geographical community in that it involves a shared practice: ways of doing things that are shared to some significant extent among members. Characteristics of A Community of Practice Wenger argues that there are three crucial characteristics of a community of practice: Domain: A common interest that connects and holds together the community; Community: A community is bound by the shared activities they pursue (for example, meetings, discussions) around their common domain; Practice: Members of a community of practice are practitioners; what they do informs their participation in the community; and what they learn from the community affects what they do. Wenger (2000) has argued that although individuals learn through participation in a community of practice, more important is the generation of newer or deeper levels of knowledge through the sum of the group activity. If the community of practice is centered around business processes, for instance, this can be of considerable benefit to an organization. Types of Communities of Practice Today, communities of practices are increasingly being used to improve knowledge management and connect people within business, government, education, and other organizations. The design of the community will look different depending on the purpose and needs of the participants. There are four basic types of communities: Helping Communities provide a forum for community members to help each other with everyday work needs. Best Practice Communities develop and disseminate best practices, guidelines, and strategies for their members’ use. Knowledge Stewarding Communities organize, manage, and steward a body of knowledge from which community members can draw. Innovation Communities create breakthrough ideas, new knowledge, and new practices. As you reflect on digital practices in university and the workplace, consider how engaging in a Community of Practice could benefit you as a learner and in your future career. Activity: What Is a Community of Practice? Watch the video, Communities of Practice (Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayner) To learn more about the origins and theory of communities of practice, see Introduction to communities of practice. Feel free to discuss your topics of interest in TWU Discourse, or search online for CoPs that interest you. 5.3 Connecting and Learning through Social Media Activity: Mapping My Social Network Online communities are varied and can be categorized by their purpose: social, academic, professional, etc. For this activity, we encourage you to consider what your purpose is in building an online community. What are your goals? Do you want to connect with TWU peers internationally and in Canada? Is your focus on academic support, or building personal relationships? Are you interested in the communities that relate to your chosen profession? If so, do a quick search for online communities for a career that interests you (see example for businesses: 15 Best Online Community Platforms of 2023 (Ranked)). Do you want to engage with online communities that align with your personal interests? (e.g. sports, arts, politics, gardening, coding, etc.) Write down your goals for joining an online community. Next, consider the networks you are currently a part of. You may want to refer back to Unit 1 in which you created a Personal Learning Network map. Now, with a focus on networking, create your own Social Map. See the following example from Brian Solis, a digital analyst, anthropologist and author. Brian Solis Online - Social Map flickr photo by The Brian Solis shared under a Creative Commons (BY) license Finally, reflect on the social media technologies you use for learning and how this impacts on your digital footprint and online identity. Activity: Social Media for Connecting and Learning In this activity we will explore how social media can support online learning and engagement.

Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS101. Activity: Social Media, Online Identity, and Learning Join the Discourse discussion forum on social media, online identity and learning by sharing your personal views and thoughts. Choose one or more of the following questions as a catalyst for your contributions to the forum: How much of what you learn should be open and transparent (i.e. public) and how much should be kept private? Why? In a digital age, how important is it for you to build a digital footprint of your learning? What are the challenges and opportunities for building your online identity? What levels of online engagement do your feel are appropriate for your own learning on this course? Does this differ from your engagement in other online communities? Other? Please “like”, share and reply to posts. These are forms of engagement and a contribution to your online learning identity. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS101 5.4 Connecting to the TWU Community Our final topic focuses on the TWU community and how you can participate both online and on campus. As a TWU student you have the opportunity to connect with a diverse student body, faculty and staff. What role does technology play in how you communicate with your peers, collaborate on projects, and build relationships? In this unit we have discussed what it means to be a digital citizen, and how we can engage with online communities. How does this apply to you as a TWU stude nt? As we wrap up this unit, we encourage you to reflect on your personal and academic goals and how you can engage with the TWU community. Activity: TWU’s Learning Community Take a moment to re-read the course description for this course: Introduces theories and competencies related to learning and thriving in a digital world. Explores how learners are situated in ‘the digital’ throughout their lives and how they can use digital technologies to enhance and enrich their experience of learning, working, and playing. Learners will begin to build a curated digital footprint, initiate and develop personal and professional learning networks; develop competencies to allow them to evaluate and choose digital platforms and tools that are safe and ethical; and explore how to use digital technologies to discover, curate, connect, and share knowledge with their communities. Next, focus on two key course learning outcomes: Develop personal and professional learning networks to discover and share knowledge, collaborate with others, and become engaged digital global citizens. Create inclusive digital communities which embody a sense of belonging, connection, and Christian hospitality. Finally, take a look at Trinity’s Life at TWU website. We invite all TWU students to connect, thrive, and serve in a dynamic, Christ-centred learning community where they can develop as maturing disciples, thoughtful global citizens, and compassionate servant leaders. Experience life and learning here. How might you connect, thrive, and serve through your connections and contributions online, as well as on campus? What experiences have you had so far in connecting with your peers and getting to know the TWU community? If you have not participated in the engagement opportunities presented in this course (Discourse, WordPress blog), take the time now to connect! Once you arrive in Canada, there are more opportunities to connect on campus and online. Watch Get Connected. TWU on Social Media Here are some other websites that share insights on the TWU community: - TWU Facebook page - X (Twitter) - Instagram In your Reflective Journal (Obsidian) jot down your responses to the following questions: What are your personal and academic goals for making connections at TWU? What steps will you take to make those connections? What technology or digital skills will you need to fully engage? How can connecting to the TWU community enhance your understanding of digital citizenship and online networking? Summary In this unit, you have had the opportunity to learn about what it means to be a digital citizen, including the rights and responsibilities we should abide by.

What about other 3rd party cloud storage solutions (Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, WeChat etc…)? In general, the use of unauthorized 3rd party cloud storage is not a good idea. TWU provides faculty and staff with the tools needed to collaborate internally and externally. The reasons below elaborate on the reasoning behind this position. Lack of Visibility - Since these software are not integrated into our network, there is no way we can retrieve data stored in these systems if an employee or faculty member leaves the institution and fails to disclose the usage of that account, or has it attached to a personal email account. If TWU data are present in those accounts, then it can be easily lost or compromised, which can lead to institutional and legal consequences. Lack of Accountability - There is no way to effectively manage information security if a faculty or staff member is using unauthorized cloud storage. Additionally, there is no way to know if those data have been compromised and no ability for our forensics team to conduct analyses on these data in the event of a security incident. Lack of Support - We don’t offer technical support to these services. So, if something goes wrong, is lost or compromised, IT will have no way to help users who have lost data or been locked out of accounts. Collaboration - We each have our own preferences when it comes to the various technologies we like to work with. There is not always a best tool for everyone. However, collaboration becomes more difficult when each individual or department selects there own collaboration platforms, prioritizing individual needs above the whole. Student Centred - We will put students first. These guidelines ensure we are protecting information and ultimately protecting our students. We have been entrusted with a great deal of personal and private information and must ensure the decisions we make are protecting that information.

Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to have a significant impact on society and business. Examples include, autonomous cars, computers understanding human speech and machine learning. Consider for instance, that computer chess games available for commercial desktop machines have the ability to beat accomplished chess players including grand masters. And of course, Chat GPT. In this section we introduce a few interesting examples of artificial intelligence to provide a sense of how sophisticated these technologies are becoming. First, let’s define AI: “The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages” (Oxford Reference) “The capacity of a computer to perform operations analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as by an expert system, a program for CAD or CAM, or a program for the perception and recognition of shapes in computer vision systems” (Dictionary.com) What is your experience with AI? Have you used an AI tool, such as Grammerly or ChatGPT? How has this technology affected you as a student, and what effect do you think it has/will have on your chosen profession? In the next activity, we’ll explore some of these questions and concerns. Activity: How Can I Use AI as a Student? First, do a quick search online for AI tools for university students. Examples: - How can AI be used by university students? - The 10 Best AI Tools to Help Students Learn Faster Intrigued? Do you find any tech tools that would be useful in understanding course topics, studying, generating flashcards, transcribing lectures and voice notes, correcting grammar, writing an essay, creating a slideshow presentation, drafting a forum discussion post, etc.? Do any of these capabilites concern you? Do you think they concern your professors or fellow students? Review TWU’s policy on Academic Misconduct &amp; Fraud. Is it Academic Fraud if you use Chat GPT to complete assignments? Search online for key words related to this issue, such as “university concern policy artificial intelligence” and you will find numerous articles on the use of AI in universities, as well as emerging policies. For example, the University of Toronto’s guidelines for ChatGPT and Generative AI in the Classroom Here are some guidelines you may receive from your instructors at TWU: • Students are encouraged to make use of technology, including generative artificial intelligence tools, to contribute to their understanding of course materials. • Students must submit, as an appendix with their assignments, any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool, and the prompt used to generate the content. • Any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool must be cited appropriately. Many organizations that publish standard citation formats are now providing information on citing generative AI (e.g., MLA: https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/ ). • Students may use artificial intelligence tools for creating an outline for an assignment, but the final submitted assignment must be original work produced by the individual student alone. • Students may not use artificial intelligence tools for taking tests, writing research papers, creating computer code, or completing major course assignments. However, these tools may be useful when gathering information from across sources and assimilating it for understanding. If you have any question about the use of AI applications for course work, please speak with your instructor.

Activity: Forum: Philanthropy and corporate advertising Read the following case study: The OERu is a charitable organisation which provides open online courses for free, using open educational resources which any educational institution can adopt, modify and reuse. There are costs that need to be covered to sustain the OERu: for example, the assembly of open online courses, hosting of the server and software infrastructure, staff to coordinate and support the initiative. etc. The OERu does not generate any revenue from corporate services, by, for example, allowing advertising on the OERu course sites for a share of the advertising revenue. Moreover, the OERu does not sell or generate revenue from personal data learners provide by using these free learning services, therefore users are not the product of this service. Discussion Join the discussion on philanthropy and corporate advertising. The key question is how can non-profit organisations sustain free educational services for those who can’t afford traditional education provision? Consider the following issues: As a learner, how would you feel if the course materials included corporate advertising? If advertising were to be supported, how would you feel if the OERu course sites required you to switch off any ad-blockers before gaining access to the course materials? Is it appropriate for publicly funded institutions and charities working in education to generate revenue from corporate advertising to support and sustain free online services? What are the risks and opportunities? Should education institutions and educational charities accept significant corporate sponsorship in return for profiling proprietary products? The OERu has recommended that learners use free blogging services to share their learning outputs. Many of these services carry advertising. How do you feel about using these services – being the product rather than consumer? Would it be better for OERu to recommend that learners use a paid service without advertising? How would this impact on learners who do not have sufficient funds to afford maintaining a domain of their own? Other?

The future is still so much bigger than the past.” — Time Berners-Lee The World Wide Web was originally designed to provide universal access to a large universe of documents. To achieve universal access, it was paramount to design the web as an open system without a central locus of control. However, on the Internet there are an increasing number of “walled gardens” that aim to control user’s access to content and services. In this section we explore the concept of net neutrality and reflect on the risks associated with universal access to online information. Activity: The Meaning of Net Neutrality Watch Net Neutrality Explained 6.4 Digital Wisdom To conclude our course, we will examine another perspective on ethics and technology. This may tap into the foundational lens by which you approach many ethical issues, so take a moment to reflect on the following: What role does technology play in my social, academic, and spiritual life? What guidance does the Bible have on our use of technology today? How will my use of technology support my social, academic, and spiritual goals? Activity: Digital Wisdom Skim the following article in which the authors present a framework for digital wisdom, as well as practical practices that can help navigate the digital in our daily lives. A Framework for Digital Wisdom in Higher Education Here are some quotes that resonate with me. Feel free to highlight your quotes using Hypothes.is, or in your personal Obsidian notes. “Institutions of higher education have a crucial role and responsibility at this moment of technological change to form people who will flourish in our so-called digital age.” (para 1) “Within the context of Christian higher education, the need to integrate new ICTs into our individual and institutional lives well and wisely—as we consider what technologies are doing to us and what we will do with them—is of utmost significance if we are committed to the cultivation of competence, character, and wisdom.” (para 6) “Scripture enables us look behind and beyond our and others’ online identities to see ourselves and others as embodied and relational beings made in the image of God.” (para 21) “Our use of technologies must be shaped by our intentions and values, and we must be aware of how platform interfaces, permissions, algorithms, and other design elements could interfere with our goals and obligations.” (para 31) Questions to Consider Answer the following questions in your personal journal: How can you, as a TWU student, flourish in this digital age? How do the tools you use shape you? How do you use them wisely? How should we view and relate to others online - in particular those whom we disagree with?
