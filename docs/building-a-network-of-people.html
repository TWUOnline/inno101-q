<p>Before attempting to define digital citizenship let’s consider the concept of citizenship in its own right. In its simplest form, citizenship refers to the rights, privileges and duties of being a national citizen. However, the concept of being a good citizen encompasses much more, particularly if you think about full engagement as a member of society.</p>

<p>“Citizenship is a status that is bestowed on those who are full members of a community.”<br />

<p>Defining digital citizenship is not easy because it means different things to different people. It is also a concept which is debated among scholars researching the field.</p>
<p>If you conduct a general search for “digital citizenship” you will find many links referencing resources targeting the school-level, with a focus on safe, skilled and ethical use of online technology. While these aspects are important, for the purposes of this tertiary-level course, we need to explore the concept of digital citizenship in more detail.</p>

<p>The concept of citizenship encompasses the rights and responsibilities of individuals. We need to consider what rights and responsibilities come with digital citizenship. In this mini challenge, we explore this topic with particular emphasis on the rights and responsibilities associated with learning in a digital age.</p>
<p>Following the hype of massive open online courses (MOOC) and the New York Times declaring 2012 the “year of the MOOC,“ a small group of educators drafted “A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in a Digital Age.” This document forms the basis for a course discussion on the rights and responsibilities of digital citizens.</p>

<p>Purpose<br />
The purpose of this mini challenge is to review and identify the primary rights and responsibilities for tertiary education learners in a digital age and to participate in a discussion of topical issues.</p>
<p>Tasks<br />
Read A Proposal for Rights and Responsibilities for Citizens in the Digital World with particular reference to identifying rights and responsibilities appropriate for college-level online study. Note that the publication is almost a decade old. Is this list still relevant today? What would you amend or add to update this proposal.<br />
Conduct a general search for rights and responsibilities of digital citizenship to assist in refining your own list for tertiary online study. Your search is likely to generate many results developed for the school sector, so you need to evaluate if these rights and responsibilities are appropriate for tertiary.<br />

Topical Issues – Rights and Responsibilities for Learning in a Digital Age<br />
Drawing on your knowledge and experience, please join the discussion on topical issues regarding rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age at the tertiary level. You can discuss the topical issues listed below, or add new ones to the forum. In each case, justify your position taking opposing views into account.</p>
<p>Topical Issues</p>
<p>Should higher education institutions have the right to determine what software applications learners should use for their studies?
Data generated by learners belongs to the learners, therefore should they have the right to access their data (for example forum discussion contributions) even after the course has completed?<br />
Should higher education institutions reserve the right to ban disruptive learners from their learning platforms?<br />
Where legally permissible, should learners have the right to access all course materials without the need to register a password?<br />
Should higher education institutions have the right to limit the time required for completing a course?<br />
Others?
We encourage learners to reply and “like” good posts. (Remember to tag your posts using the course code: lida102).</p>

<p>As an online learner, you are probably well versed in maintaining good online hygiene.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in this section we summarize important practices as a reminder to remain vigilant in protecting your privacy and security online. If you are unsure about good security practices, there are a wealth of online resources you can (and should) consult.</p>
<p>Pile of keys.jpg<br />
Privacy<br />
Your privacy is fragile, easy to lose instantaneously, and difficult to retrieve in an environment that requires so much online interaction.</p>
<p>“Identity theft” happens, frequently.<br />
Never put your social security number, your birthday, your mother’s maiden name, or any other personal facts, anywhere online. Everyone on the Internet will be able to access this information.</p>
<p>Always assume that anything you write online (including email) can, and probably will, eventually leak. Keep your email address private – to avoid receiving spam. If you email is published in a plain form anywhere on line, even if it is part of an archived email list, spammers will “harvest” it for their databases.</p>
<p>Spam email – at least half of all email being sent – is an unfortunate fact of our modern lives. If you must publish your email address online, consider creating a “sacrificial” email address, or one you only use to publish online. You can create an email “alias,” which you can set to automatically forward to your primary email, and easily disable if your spam volumes increases.</p>
<p>Another approach is to avoid publishing the email address as something like <a href="mailto:myname@somewebdomain.net" class="email">myname@somewebdomain.net</a>… Instead you might use more confusing text, such as myname-at-somewebdomain-net. Some websites support using these types of obfuscation methods, but the spammers who “scrape” email addresses from websites to populate their spam databases use increasingly sophisticated methods to defeat these methods. Basically, avoid publishing the email addresses you value online to decrease the amount of spam you receive.</p>
<p>Passwords
What about passwords? Many people have just one, or maybe a few. Given the number of websites and web services which require password-based authentication, this is not good enough to avoid an identity disaster.</p>
<p>The problem with having only a few passwords is that even resource-rich and security-critical organizations have suffered massive leaks. If even one of them suffers a data leak, identity thieves will obtain your password and try to use it on other websites. It is easy for them to do this using computer technologies.</p>
<p>Other ways someone can get your password include:</p>
<p>Sniffing traffic when you log into a non-secure website that uses <a href="http://" class="uri">http://</a> rather than <a href="https://" class="uri">https://</a> – the “s” stands for secure because your data transmission’s encrypted. Look for the Lock icon.png in your address bar.<br />
Sniffing emails – your email, unless encrypted, is not secure. Never send a login and password along with the web address of a service (similarly, don’t send credit card numbers).<br />
Phishing attacks – where someone sends you an email that looks like it is from a trusted sender, such as from a friend, your bank, an online store you frequent, or a government agency, and they ask you to enter your password to confirm it. No one should ever ask you to enter your password via email.<br />
Always check the web address (hover over the link) to make sure it corresponds to the right place, or call the sender to confirm the request over the phone.<br />
Brute force – hackers often use computers to guess your password, beginning with a list of common passwords, and try different combinations until they get it right, or until the system locks them out for trying too many times.<br />
“How secure is my password” sites – you should avoid these sites and never type your password into a website or email response that is not appropriate, especially when you know the sender also knows your email.<br />
Once your email and any password combination are known, identity thieves will try to use them at various websites, because they know most people only use a few passwords. A thief who discovers a password you created for a website you rarely use will try to compromise the security of a website that is important to you – such as your email system, your workplace, social media accounts, or bank account.</p>
<p>There are services you can use to check if your email is part of a leaked password data set. So, what can you do to protect yourself?</p>
<p>Password Managers<br />
Get a password manager. They are incredibly helpful and convenient now that many of us use several computers and mobile devices. Password managers help you manage your passwords.</p>
<p>When you choose a password manager, make sure you create one strong password, such as a full sentence with some numbers and special characters. This is all you need to remember – the password manager remembers the others. The ensures you generate a different, fully-random password for each website you use that requires a password.</p>
<p>Good password managers only ever store your details in an encrypted form, where even the company that stores it cannot see your passwords. To access your passwords, you log into the password manager service using your single, strong password (via a secure web link – usually the default, but always check!).</p>
<p>There are many password manager options. Some widely used proprietary options include Lastpass and 1password. Open source options also exist. Sadly, some of the most popular password managers have suffered from software bugs that have exposed user passwords.</p>
<p>Good Messaging Hygiene<br />
Always assume that anyone can and will read anything you write in an email. Email is not a secure form of communication. Few people encrypt their email, because it is an extra step that even the most technically-inclined users are reluctant to take. Both sender and recipient have to be technically proficient.</p>
<p>Text messages and instant messaging, such as Facebook messenger, are also insecure. Anyone, including government officials and the organization that runs the service, such as Facebook employees, can read it.</p>
<p>Secure your Own Privacy<br />
Never send any sensitive data, such as your social security number, credit card number, password, or other personal information via email or text. Call the person to provide this information over the phone.</p>
<p>You can use a secure, encrypted, text message service, such as Signal if necessary. It is available at no cost, works on most platforms, and encrypts text messages on your phone. If you text someone else with Signal installed, the entire transaction is encrypted.</p>
<p>Secure the Privacy of Others<br />
Another element of good digital hygiene is to protect the identity of others. For example, never send group emails using To: or CC: (carbon copy) for each email address. You will reveal the email addresses for everyone on your list. This is especially problematic if you or another person saves the email message and displays it on the web, such as in a mailing list archive. This makes it easy for spammers and hackers to access and download all of those email addresses.</p>
<p>Use BCC: (blind carbon copy), to hide the email addresses from your recipients, to protect everyone’s privacy. Use your own email address, and BCC the rest of the recipients, if your email software requires you to insert an email address into the To: box.</p>
<p>When using an email mailing list, where you send messages to a single email address to a list of people, never CC: someone else in the same message. This will compromise the privacy of every CC’d recipient and the privacy of the list. Always check with the people on the list to ensure you are not taking unacceptable liberties.</p>
<p>If someone asks you to share an email address of a friend or colleague, you should ask permission to share their email address, and state why the third party is requesting their email.</p>
<p>Be a Thoughtful Sceptic<br />
So how can we protect ourselves if new threats are emerging all the time?</p>
<p>Be conscious of where you put information that is “private” to you.<br />
Beware of the terms of service of social media providers, such as Facebook. Use a service like “TOSDR” to help identify risky, overreaching services. You may be able to use certain privacy settings to protect your information.<br />
Always check the identity of a website before you enter any passwords or personal information. Secure certificates are generally trustworthy, but be sure check the names and details.<br />
Always ask whether you should trust a provider or a government agency. Always ask “who benefits when I do this?” What are their incentives?<br />
Protect your own data and be even more protective of others’ private information. For example, be cautious before posting information about yourself or someone else. Be especially cautious when posting pictures or videos of their children.<br />
Remember, complacency and unwarranted trust are your biggest enemies. A healthy paranoia is good for your digital health. Think about the great amount of time and effort it will take to regain your identity (and credit rating) if your information is compromised.</p>

Frameworks for Online Engagement<br />
Read Derek Wenmouth’s blog post: Participation online – Four C’s. How does this apply to your own online engagement?<br />
Watch the following video based on Ross Mayfield’s Power Law of Participation. Note how low threshold engagement on social media leaves a bread crumb (digital footprint) and generates a form of collective intelligence. Higher forms of engagement result in collaborative intelligence. Note that Cheryl Reynolds refers to Yammer in the video, but the framework also applies to other social media platforms. While you watch the video, think about how you engage in different online communities.</p>
<p>Forum – Social Media, Online Identity, and Learning<br />
Join the discussion on social media, online identity and learning by sharing your personal views and thoughts. Choose one or more of the following questions as a catalyst for your contributions to the forum:</p>
<p>How much of what you learn should be open and transparent (i.e. public) and how much should be kept private? Why?<br />
In a digital age, how important is it for you to build a digital footprint of your learning?<br />
What are the challenges and opportunities for building your online identity?<br />
What levels of online engagement do your feel are appropriate for your own learning on this course? Does this differ from your engagement in other online communities?<br />

<p><span class="blockhead">Digital Citizenship Challenge</span></p>
<p>After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to prepare a learning reflection based on the knowledge you have gained on the concept of digital citizenship.</p>
<p>This learning challenge is based on the learning activities in this unit. You are encouraged to complete this assignment on your blog. Note that you can control the privacy settings of each post (e.g. only you can see it &gt; only your instructor &gt; your TWU peers &gt; open to all who come across it on the web!).</p>
<p>In your Reflective post, provide the following:<br />
- your personal description of digital citizenship;<br />
- your revised definition of digital citizenship based on your research of the topic;<br />
- list of university-level study examples of the elements of digital citizenship;<br />
- a summary of the primary rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age;</p>
<p>Resources:
- video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk2GjRIRBIk">How to Write a Reflection Essay</a> by Melissa Wehler</p>
<p>In addition to the tasks above, prepare a learning reflection of about 500–600 words reflecting on the development of your understanding of digital citizenship.</p>
<p>Your post should cover the following aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Provide your reader with specifically what happened?<br />
<strong>Evaluation</strong>: What was “good” and “bad” about the experience?<br />
<strong>Analysis</strong>: What did you learn from it? How do you feel about it now? Did it change you? How?<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong>: What alternatives did you have at the time or what else could you have done?<br />
<strong>Plan</strong>: What new knowledge or skills do you have and how will your experience inform future learning?</p>
<p>Add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: ldrs399.<br />
See how to add a tag in WordPress or in Blogger see Change settings on your posts to add a label.<br />
The tag is needed for the harvester we use to identify posts for the LiDA course. If the tag is missing, we will not be able to incorporate your post into the course feed. This is done automatically once you have registered your blog url on the course site (see below).<br />
You will need to register the full url for the PUBLIC view of your blog site. We need this url to harvest posts tagged or labelled with hash tag “lida102” for the aggregated course feed. Please note that it may take up to an hour before your posts appear in the feed due. If the post does not appear in the feed after a few hours, check that you registered the correct url for the published view and tagged / labelled your post using the course code.<br />
To register your blog url, click on the user icon in the site menu above. If you’re logged in, use the update button to enter the full url of the PUBLIC view of your blog. (Tip: Don’t use the dashboard url used for editing your blog).<br />
Post a comment on one or two blog contributions.</p>
