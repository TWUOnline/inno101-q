<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Digital Citizenship<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#digital-citizenship" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Before attempting to define <em>digital citizenship</em>, let’s consider the concept of citizenship in its own right. In its simplest form, citizenship refers to the rights, privileges and duties of being a national citizen. However, the concept of being a good citizen encompasses much more, particularly if you think about full engagement as a member of society.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Citizenship is a status that is bestowed on those who are full members of a community.”<br />
—T.H. Marshall</p>

<h3>Activity: Reflecting on Digital Citizenship<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#activity-reflecting-on-digital-citizenship" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>If good citizenship means to fulfill your role as citizen, can you think of five things good citizens do? Consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a digital world, is loyalty to your country a necessary component of the definition of good citizenship?<br />
</li>
<li>Is education a pre-requisite for good citizenship?<br />
</li>
<li>In a digital world, what does it mean to be a global citizen? Read the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_citizenship_education">Global Citizenship Education</a> where learners engage in solving real world problems.<br />
</li>
<li>Has the concept of good citizenship changed over time? In what ways?<br />
</li>
<li>Does citizenship require active community engagement?

</li>
<li>Why has the concept <em>digital</em> been linked with <em>citizenship</em> or should we drop the word <em>digital</em> and just talk about <em>good citizenship</em>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Write your thoughts in your Reflective Journal (using Obsidian or WordPress).</p>
<p>Conclude by writing down a description of “digital citizenship” in your own words. (You will need this later for the assessment. It does not need to be a scholarly definition – just your personal thoughts on the concept.)</p>

<h3>Defining Digital Citizenship<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#defining-digital-citizenship" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Defining digital citizenship is not easy because it means different things to different people. It is also a concept which is debated among scholars researching the field.</p>
<p>If you conduct a general search for “digital citizenship” you will find many links referencing resources targeting the school-level, with a focus on safe, skilled and ethical use of online technology. While these aspects are important, for the purposes of this tertiary-level course, we need to explore the concept of digital citizenship in more detail.</p>

<h3>Activity: Refined Definition of Digital Citizenship<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#activity-refined-definition-of-digital-citizenship" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>The purpose of this activity is to explore the elements of digital citizenship with particular emphasis on those relevant to your academic study.</p>
<p>Read through the following resources in order to refine your own definition of what it means to be a Digital Citizen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Online Search:</strong><br />
- Read the introductory section of the Wikipedia article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_citizen">Digital citizen</a><br />
- Conduct a general search for “definition of digital citizen.” Choose the two best definitions and add these to the library of your citation management tool (Hypothes.is / Zotero / Obsidian), or keep a record for citation purposes.<br />
- Try and locate one recent scholarly definition for “digital citizen.” Record the reference for citation purposes. How recent is the reference?</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Social Media Search:</strong>
- Explore the recent tweets (on X or whichever social media app you prefer) using the following hashtags: #digitalcitizenship, #digiciz, and #digicit. Compile a list of elements relating to the concept of digital citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Read &amp; Comment:</strong>
- Login to hypothes.is.<br />
- Read <a href="https://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html">Nine elements of digital citizenship</a> by Mike Ribble<br />
- Feel free to add or reply to annotations using Hypothes.is. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: #LDRS101 (This is needed to harvest posts for the course feed.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Apply the Elements</strong>
Generate a table listing the nine elements of digital citizenship and identify a practical example of the element for your academic study: For example:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="28%" />
<col width="72%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Element</strong></th>
<th><strong>Academic Study Example</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Digital access</td>
<td>Students from low income countries may not have reliable or affordable access to the Internet.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Digital commerce</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Digital communication</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Digital literacy</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Digital etiquette</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Digital law</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Digital rights and responsibilities</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Digital health and wellness</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Digital security</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Step 5: Define Digital Citizenship</strong>
After completing the steps above, revise your personal description of digital citizenship. Does your new definition differ from your initial description?</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Share Your Insights!</strong>
Share a reflection on this activiy by posting either in your blog or on the Discourse forum.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t realize the … is part of digital citizenship because …<br />
</li>
<li>… is not particularly relevant for university learners because …<br />

<h3>Rights and Responsibilities<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#rights-and-responsibilities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The concept of citizenship encompasses the rights and responsibilities of individuals. We need to consider what rights and responsibilities come with digital citizenship. In this mini challenge, we explore this topic with particular emphasis on the rights and responsibilities associated with learning in a digital age.</p>
<p>Following the hype of massive open online courses (MOOC) and the New York Times declaring 2012 the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html">year of the MOOC</a>,“ a small group of educators drafted “A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in a Digital Age.” This document forms the basis for a course discussion on the rights and responsibilities of digital citizens.</p>

<h3>Personal and Professional Identity<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#personal-and-professional-identity" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In short, digital citizenship is about being a person on the web. In the previous unit on building your online presence, we noted that individuals portray different personas online, for example personal, academic and professional.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we need to be careful about what we post online because this can have a negative impact on future career prospects or current employment. We must also be cognisant of the different limitations that different careers place on what can be shared publicly and what needs to stay private. On the other hand, building a strong learning or professional network online is very powerful in staying up to date with new trends and establishing connections with your peers.</p>
<p>In this section, we reflect on the balance between public and private in a digital world, recognising that this is going to be different for each person depending on their own environments and professional circumstances. We will also explore how like-minded professionals in your field of interest network online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The impact exercised by ICTs is due to at least four major transformations: the blurring of the distinction between reality and virtuality; the blurring of the distinction between human, machine and nature; the reversal from information scarcity to information abundance; and the shift from the primacy of stand-alone things, properties, and binary relations, to the primacy of interactions, processes and networks.” —Luciano Floridi</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Online Communities<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#online-communities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In this section we explore the topic of online communities and how we can engage in social media to enhance our learning.</p>
<p>In the early years of the internet, there was a strong research interest in studying the differences between virtual and real communities. However, in more recent years, we have observed a blurring of the boundaries between online and real communities. In <a href="https://quiip.com.au/is-there-a-definitive-difference-between-online-and-real-life-community/">The difference between online &amp; real life community?</a> Alison Michalk states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Community boundaries are blurred to the extent that the Internet is nothing more than a conduit for communication. The Internet is now just another tool that we use to communicate within our various communities. The same as we use mail, telephone and even a car to keep in touch with our friends, family and colleagues. Our ‘real life communities’ are not mutually exclusive from our ‘online communities’ given that it all comes down to implied physical presence. (2013, June 27)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how do we join and contribute constructively to these digital communities? If you don’t have much experience with online communities, we enccourage you to participate in the course forums and become an active member of the TWU online learning community.</p>
<div id="activity-mapping-my-social-network" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Activity: Mapping My Social Network<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#activity-mapping-my-social-network" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>Online communities are varied and can be categorized by their purpose: social, academic, professional, etc. For this activity, we encourage you to consider what your purpose is in building an online community.<br />
- Do you want to connect with TWU peers internationally and in Canada? Is your focus on academic support, or building personal relationships?<br />
- Are you interested in the communities that relate to your chosen profession? If so, do a quick search for online communities for a career that interests you (see example for businesses: <a href="https://www.mightynetworks.com/resources/community-platforms">15 Best Online Community Platforms of 2023 (Ranked)</a>.<br />
- Do you want to engage with online communities that align with your personal interests? (e.g. sports, arts, politics, gardening, coding, etc.)</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Write down your goals for joining an online community.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, consider the networks you are currently a part of. You may want to refer back to Unit 1 in which you created a <a href="https://twu-innovation.github.io/inno101/introduction-to-digital-literacies-for-online-learning.html#activity-pln-mapping-challenge">Personal Learning Network map</a>.</p></li>

<h3>Communities of Practice<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#communities-of-practice" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>As you continue to reflect on your social network and consider other learning networks to join for personal or professional growth, we want to present another framing of an online community called a <strong><em>Community of Practice</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A community of practice (CoP) is a group of people who “share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly”. Wenger, 2014</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cognitive anthropologists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger coined the term “community of practice” when studying apprenticeships as a learning model—the term referred to the community that acts as a living curriculum. Once the concept was articulated the researchers started to see communities everywhere, even when no formal apprenticeship system existed.</p>
<p>The basic premise behind communities of practice is simple: we all learn in everyday life from the communities in which we find ourselves. Communities of practice are everywhere. Nearly everyone belongs to some community of practice, whether it is through our working colleagues or associates, our profession or trade, or our leisure interests, such as a book club. Wenger (2000) argues that a community of practice is different from a community of interest or a geographical community in that it involves a shared practice: ways of doing things that are shared to some significant extent among members.</p>
<div id="characteristics-of-a-community-of-practice" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Characteristics of A Community of Practice<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#characteristics-of-a-community-of-practice" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Wenger argues that there are three crucial characteristics of a community of practice:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Domain:</strong> A common interest that connects and holds together the community;</li>
<li><strong>Community:</strong> A community is bound by the shared activities they pursue (for example, meetings, discussions) around their common domain;<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Practice:</strong> Members of a community of practice are practitioners; what they do informs their participation in the community; and what they learn from the community affects what they do.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wenger (2000) has argued that although individuals learn through participation in a community of practice, more important is the generation of newer or deeper levels of knowledge through the sum of the group activity. If the community of practice is centered around business processes, for instance, this can be of considerable benefit to an organization.</p>
</div>
<div id="types-of-communities-of-practice" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Types of Communities of Practice<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#types-of-communities-of-practice" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Today, communities of practices are increasingly being used to improve knowledge management and connect people within business, government, education, and other organizations.</p>
<p>The design of the community will look different depending on the purpose and needs of the participants. There are four basic types of communities:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Helping Communities</strong> provide a forum for community members to help each other with everyday work needs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Best Practice Communities</strong> develop and disseminate best practices, guidelines, and strategies for their members’ use.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge Stewarding Communities</strong> organize, manage, and steward a body of knowledge from which community members can draw.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Innovation Communities</strong> create breakthrough ideas, new knowledge, and new practices.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As you reflect on digital practices in university and the workplace, consider how engaging in a Community of Practice could benefit you as a learner and in your future career.</p>

<h3>Artificial Intelligence<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#artificial-intelligence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to have a significant impact on society and business. Examples include, autonomous cars, computers understanding human speech and machine learning. Consider for instance, that computer chess games available for commercial desktop machines have the ability to beat accomplished chess players including grand masters. And of course, Chat GPT.</p>
<p>In this section we introduce a few interesting examples of artificial intelligence to provide a sense of how sophisticated these technologies are becoming.</p>
<p>First, let’s define AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages” (<a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095426960">Oxford Reference</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The capacity of a computer to perform operations analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as by an expert system, a program for CAD or CAM, or a program for the perception and recognition of shapes in computer vision systems” (<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial-intelligence">Dictionary.com</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your experience with AI? Have you used an AI tool, such as Grammerly or ChatGPT? How has this technology affected you as a student, and what effect do you think it has/will have on your chosen profession?</p>
<p>In the next activity, we’ll explore some of these questions and concerns.</p>

<h3>Activity: How Can I Use AI as a Student?<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#activity-how-can-i-use-ai-as-a-student" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>First, do a quick search online for AI tools for university students.
Examples:
- <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/how-can-ai-be-used-university-students">How can AI be used by university students?</a>- <a href="https://mystudylife.com/10-best-ai-tools-to-help-students-learn-faster/">The 10 Best AI Tools to Help Students Learn Faster</a>)</p>
<p>Intrigued? Do you find any tech tools that you might use to help you with understanding course topics, studying, generating flashcards, transcribing lectures and voice notes, grammar, writing an essay, creating a slideshow presentation, drafting a forum discussion post, etc.?</p>
<p>Do any of these capabilites concern you? Do you think they concern your professors or fellow students?</p>
<p>Review TWU’s policy on <a href="https://www.twu.ca/about-us/policies-guidelines/university-policies/academic-misconduct-fraud">Academic Misconduct &amp; Fraud</a>.</p>
<p>Search online for key words related to this issue, such as “university concern policy artificial intelligence” and you will find numerous articles on the use of AI in universities, as well as emerging policies. For example, the University of Toronto’s guidelines for <a href="https://www.viceprovostundergrad.utoronto.ca/strategic-priorities/digital-learning/special-initiative-artificial-intelligence/">ChatGPT and Generative AI in the Classroom</a></p>
<p>Here is one more article that discusses the pros and cons for English Learners using AI in their studies: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374483468_Perspectives_of_the_Use_of_ChatGPT_as_a_Tool_for_Online_Education_of_English">Perspectives of the Use of ChatGPT as a Tool for Online Education of English</a></p>

<h3>Activity: Forum: Philanthropy and corporate advertising<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#activity-forum-philanthropy-and-corporate-advertising" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>Read the following case study:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://oeru.org/">OERu</a> is a charitable organisation which provides open online courses for free, using open educational resources which any educational institution can adopt, modify and reuse. There are costs that need to be covered to sustain the OERu: for example, the assembly of open online courses, hosting of the server and software infrastructure, staff to coordinate and support the initiative. etc. The OERu does not generate any revenue from corporate services, by, for example, allowing advertising on the OERu course sites for a share of the advertising revenue. Moreover, the OERu does not sell or generate revenue from personal data learners provide by using these free learning services, therefore users are not the product of this service.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Join the discussion on philanthropy and corporate advertising. The key question is how can non-profit organisations sustain free educational services for those who can’t afford traditional education provision?</p>
<p>Consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a learner, how would you feel if the course materials included corporate advertising? If advertising were to be supported, how would you feel if the OERu course sites required you to switch off any ad-blockers before gaining access to the course materials?<br />
</li>
<li>Is it appropriate for publicly funded institutions and charities working in education to generate revenue from corporate advertising to support and sustain free online services? What are the risks and opportunities?<br />
</li>
<li>Should education institutions and educational charities accept significant corporate sponsorship in return for profiling proprietary products?<br />
</li>
<li>The OERu has recommended that learners use free blogging services to share their learning outputs. Many of these services carry advertising. How do you feel about using these services – being the product rather than consumer? Would it be better for OERu to recommend that learners use a paid service without advertising? How would this impact on learners who do not have sufficient funds to afford maintaining a domain of their own?<br />

<li>Other?</li>

<p>Net neutrality</p>
<p>“ The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past. ”
—Time Berners-Lee</p>
<p>The World Wide Web was originally designed to provide universal access to a large universe of documents. To achieve universal access, it was paramount to design the web as an open system without a central locus of control. However, on the Internet there are an increasing number of “walled gardens” that aim to control user’s access to content and services. In this section we explore the concept of net neutrality and reflect on the risks associated with universal access to online information.</p>

<p>This video was produced in 2015, where the big concern of net neutrality seemed to relate to companies controlling our access to information on the internet. (Notice around the 2 minute mark where opposing political parties are supported/blamed for their view on the topic…without the video actually explaining the oppossing views.)</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2023 where the concern is now government oversight in what information we see.</p>
<p>This issue is highly controversial and politisized. If you are interested in exploring the topic…which means encountering diverse views on the subject, read on! As we learn with technology, we have to consider what information is available on the internet…and whether there are any restrictions on information that would help us as citizens make informed decisions.</p>
<p>If interested, peruse the following resources. Trigger alert! These perspective range from liberal to conservative points of view. This course aims to promote critical thinking of what we consume and produce online. Refer back to the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acc4zY1sQ0o">Building More Creative Social Networks</a>. Will encountering an opposing point of view contribute to your understanding of an issue?</p>

<p>In addition to the challenges associated with net neutrality, think about how closed technologies can build walled gardens, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Apple iOS which is restricted to running pre-approved applications on the hardware purchased by the user.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>The Amazon Kindle line of e-readers intentionally designed to favour the Amazon commercial ecosystem.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Video game consoles that typically require game developers to purchase a license to develop games for the platform frequently requiring approval from the platform prior to publishing the games.</p></li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Zero">Facebook Zero</a> is an application for mobile devices and business agreements with a number of companies to provide access to selected internet services without incurring data charges targeting markets where internet access may be less affordable. Facebook Zero is part of internet.org set up by Facebook and the basic websites than can be accessed for free without data charges are determined by the initiative.</p>
<p>Facebook Zero became controversial in some countries due to several issues such as net neutrality.[9] For instance, India’s Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) bans zero-rated services on account of “discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content”.[13] A criticism also stated that Facebook is practicing digital colonialism because it is not introducing open internet but building a “little web that turns the user into a mostly passive consumer of mostly western corporate content”.[11]</p>
