<p>Before attempting to define <em>digital citizenship</em>, let’s consider the concept of citizenship in its own right. In its simplest form, citizenship refers to the rights, privileges and duties of being a national citizen. However, the concept of being a good citizen encompasses much more, particularly if you think about full engagement as a member of society.</p>

<p>“Citizenship is a status that is bestowed on those who are full members of a community.”<br />

<div class="reflect">
<p>If good citizenship means to fulfill your role as citizen, can you think of five things good citizens do? Consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a digital world, is loyalty to your country a necessary component of the definition of good citizenship?<br />
</li>
<li>Is education a pre-requisite for good citizenship?<br />
</li>
<li>In a digital world, what does it mean to be a global citizen? Read the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_citizenship_education">Global Citizenship Education</a> where learners engage in solving real world problems.<br />
</li>
<li>Has the concept of good citizenship changed over time? In what ways?<br />
</li>
<li>Does citizenship require active community engagement?

<h3>Defining Digital Citizenship<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#defining-digital-citizenship" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Defining digital citizenship is not easy because it means different things to different people. It is also a concept which is debated among scholars researching the field.</p>
<p>If you conduct a general search for “digital citizenship” you will find many links referencing resources targeting the school-level, with a focus on safe, skilled and ethical use of online technology. While these aspects are important, for the purposes of this tertiary-level course, we need to explore the concept of digital citizenship in more detail.</p>

<h3>Activity: Refined Definition of Digital Citizenship<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#activity-refined-definition-of-digital-citizenship" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>The purpose of this activity is to explore the elements of digital citizenship with particular emphasis on those relevant to your academic study.</p>
<p>Read through the following resources in order to refine your own definition of what it means to be a Digital Citizen.</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Online Search:</em>
- Read the introductory section of the Wikipedia article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_citizen">Digital citizen</a><br />
- Conduct a general search for “definition of digital citizen.” Choose the two best definitions and add these to the library of your citation management tool (Hypothes.is / Zotero / Obsidian), or keep a record for citation purposes.<br />
- Try and locate one recent scholarly definition for “digital citizen.” Record the reference for citation purposes. How recent is the reference?</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Social Media Search:</em>
- Explore the recent tweets (on X or whichever social media app you prefer) using the following hashtags: #digitalcitizenship, #digiciz, and #digicit. Compile a list of elements relating to the concept of digital citizenship.</p>
<p><em>Step 3: Read &amp; Comment:</em>
- Login to hypothes.is.<br />
- Read <a href="https://www.digitalcitizenship.net/nine-elements.html">Nine elements of digital citizenship</a> by Mike Ribble<br />
- Feel free to add or reply to annotations using Hypothes.is. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: #LDRS399 (This is needed to harvest posts for the course feed.)</p>
<p><em>Step 4: Apply the Elements</em>
Generate a table listing the nine elements of digital citizenship and identify a practical example of the element for your academic study: For example:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="28%" />
<col width="72%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Element</strong></th>
<th><strong>Academic Study Example</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Digital access</td>
<td>Students from low income countries may not have reliable or affordable access to the Internet.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Digital commerce</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Digital communication</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Digital literacy</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Digital etiquette</td>

<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Digital health and wellness</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Digital security</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>Step 4: Define digital citizenship</em>
After completing the steps above, revise your personal description of digital citizenship. Does your new definition differ from your initial description?</p>
<p><em>Step 4: Share Your Insights!</em>
Share a reflection on this activiy by posting either in your blog or on the Discourse forum.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>I didn’t realize the <insert element> is part of digital citizenship because …<br />
<insert element> is not particularly relevant for tertiary learners because …<br />
<insert element> is particularly relevant for tertiary learners because …</p>

<h3>Rights and Responsibilities<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#rights-and-responsibilities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The concept of citizenship encompasses the rights and responsibilities of individuals. We need to consider what rights and responsibilities come with digital citizenship. In this mini challenge, we explore this topic with particular emphasis on the rights and responsibilities associated with learning in a digital age.</p>
<p>Following the hype of massive open online courses (MOOC) and the New York Times declaring 2012 the “year of the MOOC,“ a small group of educators drafted “A Bill of Rights and Principles for Learning in a Digital Age.” This document forms the basis for a course discussion on the rights and responsibilities of digital citizens.</p>

Note that the publication is almost a decade old. Is this list still relevant today? What would you amend or add to update this proposal.<br />
Conduct a general search for rights and responsibilities of digital citizenship to assist in refining your own list for tertiary online study. Your search is likely to generate many results developed for the school sector, so you need to evaluate if these rights and responsibilities are appropriate for tertiary.<br />

Topical Issues – Rights and Responsibilities for Learning in a Digital Age<br />
Drawing on your knowledge and experience, please join the discussion on topical issues regarding rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age at the tertiary level. You can discuss the topical issues listed below, or add new ones to the forum. In each case, justify your position taking opposing views into account.</p>
<p>Topical Issues</p>
<ul>
<li>Should higher education institutions have the right to determine what software applications learners should use for their studies?<br />
</li>
<li>Data generated by learners belongs to the learners, therefore should they have the right to access their data (for example forum discussion contributions) even after the course has completed?<br />
</li>
<li>Should higher education institutions reserve the right to ban disruptive learners from their learning platforms?<br />
</li>
<li>Where legally permissible, should learners have the right to access all course materials without the need to register a password?<br />
</li>
<li>Should higher education institutions have the right to limit the time required for completing a course?<br />
</li>
<li>Others?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Activity: Online vs. “Real Communities”<a href="building-a-network-of-people.html#activity-online-vs.-real-communities" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>Contrast and compare the similarities and differences between online and real, or in-person, communities. For example:</p>
<p>Online and real communities both congregate around shared interests.
In the absence of body language, it is hard to decipher emotional intent with written communications in online discussion forums.</p>
<p>In your Reflective Journal or Blog, share a similarity or difference you identified, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Online communities are different because …</li>
<li>Real communities are different because …</li>
<li>Online and real communities are similar because …</li>
</ul>
<p>In the early years of the internet, there was a strong research interest in studying the differences between virtual and real communities. However, in more recent years, we have observed a blurring of the boundaries between online and real communities. Read the following article:</p>

Research on online communities
Research on the efficacy of online communities provides insights on selecting productive communities and how to engage. Community contributors can be classified into three types (Mocus et al 2002[1]):

Core members are responsible for guiding the development of the community and have usually been involved with the community for a long time. These members have made significant contributions to the community’s evolution and have earned leadership status. Frequently they also play an active role in moderation of the group.
Active members make regular contributions to the community.
Peripheral members occasionally contribute to the discussions and the periods of engagement are short and sporadic. “Lurkers”, that is individuals seeking answers without making contributions, are normally associated with this group.
The nature of engagement in a community is influenced by the community’s life cycle stage (A. Iriberri and G. Leroy 2009[2]):

Life cycle stage    Characteristics
Inception stage Focus is on determining the purpose, codes of conduct, funding and sustainability.
Creation stage  User-centred design and evolution including issues of privacy, anonymity, open versus closed communications.
Growth stage    Focus is on community building, for example: recruiting members, growth management, integrating new members, trust building, up-to-date content, interaction support, a few offline and online events and meetings.
Maturity stage  By this stage a community culture will have emerged with identifiable community leaders. Focus shifts to permeated management and control, recognition of contributions, recognition of loyalty, member satisfaction management and subgroup management.
Additional factors identified by the research to keep in mind include:

Network cohesion, that is the overall level of connections indicated by the network density has a positive impact on the core group as well as the success of the community (Toral et al 2010[3]).
Network structure. Successful communities need a critical mass of contributors, however there is no fixed number that determines success. Most communities can expect between 45 – 90% of non-active members, but communities with a strong and experienced core group will have a positive impact on success (Toral et al 2010[3]). Moreover, the positive effects of network structure on participation persist irrespective of the life cycle stage of the community, and activity participation influences network structure (Igl 2014[4]).
Centralization. Communities with a high degree of centralisation and control exerts a negative impact on all participation variables. (Igl 2014[4]).
Practical implications
There are many online communities, and it will be worth your effort in doing a little online research to determine the network cohesion and network structure of the community. You will be able to determine this by reviewing the archive history. Avoid communities with overly centralised control, in the long run, they are not likely to be productive.

When joining an online community, try to identify the life cycle stage by scanning the archive of posts. Young communities are likely to be more tolerant of newbie questions, as responses to these questions will provide support resources for new members in the future. It’s a good idea to search the forum for your answer before posting a question. Don’t be surprised if newbie questions go answered in mature communities, they may can even attract curt rebuttals. If you’re a long standing member of the community, post a tactful reply, for example, “Your question has already been answered” and post a link to the appropriate reply.

The best advice when joining a new community is to lurk for a while before introducing yourself so that you can become familiar with the culture and practices of the community. Fill out your profile page on the forum site, rather than posting a biography in the main discussion threads. Of course, if the community is in the creation phase, you may want to play a more active role in building the community and becoming part of the core contributors.

Higher forms of engagement result in collaborative intelligence. Note that Cheryl Reynolds refers to Yammer in the video, but the framework also applies to other social media platforms. While you watch the video, think about how you engage in different online communities.</p>

<p><span class="blockhead">Digital Citizenship Challenge</span></p>
<p>After completing this unit, including the learning activities, you are asked to prepare a learning reflection based on the knowledge you have gained on the concept of digital citizenship.</p>
<p>This learning challenge is based on the learning activities in this unit. You are encouraged to complete this assignment on your blog. Note that you can control the privacy settings of each post (e.g. only you can see it &gt; only your instructor &gt; your TWU peers &gt; open to all who come across it on the web!).</p>
<p>In your Reflective post, provide the following:<br />
- your personal description of digital citizenship;<br />
- your revised definition of digital citizenship based on your research of the topic;<br />
- list of university-level study examples of the elements of digital citizenship;<br />
- a summary of the primary rights and responsibilities for learning in a digital age;</p>
<p>Resources:
- video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk2GjRIRBIk">How to Write a Reflection Essay</a> by Melissa Wehler</p>
<p>In addition to the tasks above, prepare a learning reflection of about 500–600 words reflecting on the development of your understanding of digital citizenship.</p>
<p>Your post should cover the following aspects:</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Provide your reader with specifically what happened?<br />
<strong>Evaluation</strong>: What was “good” and “bad” about the experience?<br />
<strong>Analysis</strong>: What did you learn from it? How do you feel about it now? Did it change you? How?<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong>: What alternatives did you have at the time or what else could you have done?<br />
<strong>Plan</strong>: What new knowledge or skills do you have and how will your experience inform future learning?</p>
<p>Add a category or tag for your post using the course tag: ldrs399.<br />
See how to add a tag in WordPress or in Blogger see Change settings on your posts to add a label.<br />
The tag is needed for the harvester we use to identify posts for the LiDA course. If the tag is missing, we will not be able to incorporate your post into the course feed. This is done automatically once you have registered your blog url on the course site (see below).<br />
You will need to register the full url for the PUBLIC view of your blog site. We need this url to harvest posts tagged or labelled with hash tag “lida102” for the aggregated course feed. Please note that it may take up to an hour before your posts appear in the feed due. If the post does not appear in the feed after a few hours, check that you registered the correct url for the published view and tagged / labelled your post using the course code.<br />
To register your blog url, click on the user icon in the site menu above. If you’re logged in, use the update button to enter the full url of the PUBLIC view of your blog. (Tip: Don’t use the dashboard url used for editing your blog).<br />
Post a comment on one or two blog contributions.</p>
