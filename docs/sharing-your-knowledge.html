<strong>Shared Drive, Sharing &amp; Backup</strong>
</summary>
<p><strong><a href="https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=128533">Data &amp; Cloud Storage and Sharing</a></strong><br />
Cloud storage software provides web access to your online file storage, file sharing, and file synchronization. The only TWU approved Cloud Storage &amp; Sharing services are:<br />
- [ ] <a href="https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=71260">Microsoft OneDrive</a><br />
- [ ] <a href="https://mytwu.sharepoint.com/">Microsoft SharePoint</a><br />
- [ ] <a href="https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=15681">OwnCloud</a></p>
<p>The responsibility for storing TWU documents and files lies with the person who stores the data. Judgment is required about how and where TWU data will be stored.</p>
<p>TWU has a formal Information Security Policy and related Information Security Guidelines. This article provides some additional direction based on this set of policy and guidelines.<br />
Different data is governed by different regulations, laws, agreements, and rules; each requires different means of protection and reporting.</p>
<p><strong>What about other 3rd party cloud storage solutions (Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, WeChat etc…)?</strong>
In general, the use of unauthorized 3rd party cloud storage is not a good idea. TWU provides faculty and staff with the tools needed to collaborate internally and externally. The reasons below elaborate on the reasoning behind this position.</p>
<p><em>Lack of Visibility</em> - Since these software are not integrated into our network, there is no way we can retrieve data stored in these systems if an employee or faculty member leaves the institution and fails to disclose the usage of that account, or has it attached to a personal email account. If TWU data are present in those accounts, then it can be easily lost or compromised, which can lead to institutional and legal consequences.</p>
<p><em>Lack of Accountability</em> - There is no way to effectively manage information security if a faculty or staff member is using unauthorized cloud storage. Additionally, there is no way to know if those data have been compromised and no ability for our forensics team to conduct analyses on these data in the event of a security incident.</p>
<p><em>Lack of Support</em> - We don’t offer technical support to these services. So, if something goes wrong, is lost or compromised, IT will have no way to help users who have lost data or been locked out of accounts.</p>
<p><em>Collaboration</em> - We each have our own preferences when it comes to the various technologies we like to work with. There is not always a best tool for everyone. However, collaboration becomes more difficult when each individual or department selects there own collaboration platforms, prioritizing individual needs above the whole.</p>
<p><em>Student Centred</em> - We will put students first. These guidelines ensure we are protecting information and ultimately protecting our students. We have been entrusted with a great deal of personal and private information and must ensure the decisions we make are protecting that information.</p>
<p><strong>How to Share Data</strong>
With Microsoft OneDrive and SharePoint, you can securely share files internally and externally. However, it is important to understand the different Data Classification levels and acceptable ways to share your files (Data Protection Guidelines).</p>

<h3>Artificial Intelligence<a href="sharing-your-knowledge.html#artificial-intelligence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to have a significant impact on society and business. Examples include, autonomous cars, computers understanding human speech and machine learning. Consider for instance, that computer chess games available for commercial desktop machines have the ability to beat accomplished chess players including grand masters. And of course, Chat GPT.</p>
<p>In this section we introduce a few interesting examples of artificial intelligence to provide a sense of how sophisticated these technologies are becoming.</p>
<p>First, let’s define AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages” (<a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095426960" target="_blank">Oxford Reference</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The capacity of a computer to perform operations analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as by an expert system, a program for CAD or CAM, or a program for the perception and recognition of shapes in computer vision systems” (<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">Dictionary.com</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your experience with AI? Have you used an AI tool, such as Grammerly or ChatGPT? How has this technology affected you as a student, and what effect do you think it has/will have on your chosen profession?</p>
<p>In the next activity, we’ll explore some of these questions and concerns.</p>

<h3>Activity: How Can I Use AI as a Student?<a href="sharing-your-knowledge.html#activity-how-can-i-use-ai-as-a-student" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>First, do a quick search online for AI tools for university students.
Examples:<br />
- <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/how-can-ai-be-used-university-students" target="_blank">How can AI be used by university students?</a><br />
- <a href="https://mystudylife.com/10-best-ai-tools-to-help-students-learn-faster/" target="_blank">The 10 Best AI Tools to Help Students Learn Faster</a></p>
<p>Intrigued? Do you find any tech tools that would be useful in understanding course topics, studying, generating flashcards, transcribing lectures and voice notes, correcting grammar, writing an essay, creating a slideshow presentation, drafting a forum discussion post, etc.?</p>
<p>Do any of these capabilites concern you? Do you think they concern your professors or fellow students?</p>
<p>Review TWU’s policy on <a href="https://www.twu.ca/about-us/policies-guidelines/university-policies/academic-misconduct-fraud" target="_blank">Academic Misconduct &amp; Fraud</a>. Is it Academic Fraud if you use Chat GPT to complete assignments?</p>
<p>Search online for key words related to this issue, such as “university concern policy artificial intelligence” and you will find numerous articles on the use of AI in universities, as well as emerging policies. For example, the University of Toronto’s guidelines for <a href="https://www.viceprovostundergrad.utoronto.ca/strategic-priorities/digital-learning/special-initiative-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">ChatGPT and Generative AI in the Classroom</a></p>
<p>Here are some guidelines you may receive from your instructors at TWU:</p>
<p>• Students are encouraged to make use of technology, including generative artificial intelligence
tools, to contribute to their understanding of course materials.
• Students must submit, as an appendix with their assignments, any content produced by an
artificial intelligence tool, and the prompt used to generate the content.
• Any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool must be cited appropriately. Many
organizations that publish standard citation formats are now providing information on citing
generative AI (e.g., MLA: <a href="https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/" class="uri">https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/</a> ).
• Students may use artificial intelligence tools for creating an outline for an assignment, but the
final submitted assignment must be original work produced by the individual student alone.
• Students may not use artificial intelligence tools for taking tests, writing research papers,
creating computer code, or completing major course assignments. However, these tools may be
useful when gathering information from across sources and assimilating it for understanding.</p>
<p>If you have any question about the use of AI applications for course work, please speak with your instructor.</p>

<h3>Activity: Forum: Philanthropy and Corporate Advertising<a href="sharing-your-knowledge.html#activity-forum-philanthropy-and-corporate-advertising" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>Next, let’s explore and reflect on the relationship between corporate commercial interests and digital citizenship for learning in a digital age.</p>
<p>Read the following case study:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://oeru.org/" target="_blank">OERu</a> is a charitable organisation which provides open online courses for free, using open educational resources which any educational institution can adopt, modify and reuse. There are costs that need to be covered to sustain the OERu: for example, the assembly of open online courses, hosting of the server and software infrastructure, staff to coordinate and support the initiative. etc. The OERu does not generate any revenue from corporate services, by, for example, allowing advertising on the OERu course sites for a share of the advertising revenue. Moreover, the OERu does not sell or generate revenue from personal data learners provide by using these free learning services, therefore users are not the product of this service.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Join the discussion on philanthropy and corporate advertising. The key question is how can non-profit organisations sustain free educational services for those who can’t afford traditional education provision?</p>
<p>Consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a learner, how would you feel if the course materials included corporate advertising? If advertising were to be supported, how would you feel if the OERu course sites required you to switch off any ad-blockers before gaining access to the course materials?<br />
</li>
<li>Is it appropriate for publicly funded institutions and charities working in education to generate revenue from corporate advertising to support and sustain free online services? What are the risks and opportunities?<br />
</li>
<li>Should education institutions and educational charities accept significant corporate sponsorship in return for profiling proprietary products?<br />
</li>
<li>The OERu has recommended that learners use free blogging services to share their learning outputs. Many of these services carry advertising. How do you feel about using these services – being the product rather than consumer? Would it be better for OERu to recommend that learners use a paid service without advertising? How would this impact on learners who do not have sufficient funds to afford maintaining a domain of their own?<br />

<div id="net-neutrality" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Net Neutrality<a href="sharing-your-knowledge.html#net-neutrality" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past.”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>— Time Berners-Lee</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The World Wide Web was originally designed to provide universal access to a large universe of documents. To achieve universal access, it was paramount to design the web as an open system without a central locus of control. However, on the Internet there are an increasing number of “walled gardens” that aim to control user’s access to content and services. In this section we explore the concept of net neutrality and reflect on the risks associated with universal access to online information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Net neutrality</em></strong> is a critical concept in the realm of internet policy and regulation. It revolves around the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should treat all data on the internet equally. In other words, they should not discriminate against or charge differently based on user, content, website, application, or platform. The primary goal of net neutrality is to ensure that the internet remains an open and level playing field, where all data and information can be accessed and transmitted freely.</p>
<p><em>Arguments For Net Neutrality:</em></p>
<p>Preservation of Open Internet: Net neutrality proponents argue that it is essential to maintain the open nature of the internet, where all content is equally accessible to users. This fosters innovation, competition, and free expression.</p>
<p>Equal Access: Net neutrality ensures that users, regardless of their economic status, can access all online content without discrimination. It prevents ISPs from creating fast lanes for certain content, disadvantaging others.</p>
<p>Innovation: Without net neutrality, ISPs could prioritize certain services or websites, potentially stifling innovation by making it difficult for new, smaller players to compete on a level playing field.</p>
<p><em>Arguments Against Net Neutrality:</em></p>
<p>Investment and Infrastructure: Opponents argue that without the ability to offer paid prioritization or tiered services, ISPs may have less incentive to invest in and improve network infrastructure, potentially hindering the growth of broadband services.</p>
<p>Regulatory Overreach: Some argue that government intervention in net neutrality is unnecessary and that market forces should determine how ISPs manage their networks. They fear that regulation could lead to unintended consequences, such as the governent controling access to online content.</p>
<p>Quality of Service: In certain cases, ISPs claim that they need the flexibility to manage network traffic to provide a better quality of service for applications such as real-time video and gaming.</p>
<p><em>Concerns:</em>
Concerns surrounding net neutrality involve potential discrimination, a lack of competition, and the profound implications for free speech and innovation. The absence of robust net neutrality principles could pave the way for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to exert unwarranted control. They might throttle or obstruct access to specific websites, promote their own content, or levy extra charges for particular online services.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a significant concern of government overreach in this digital domain. The debate over how much the government should regulate the internet is a hot topic, as it could hamper innovation and limit the free sharing of information. Excessive regulation could put the power to control or tamper with online content in the hands of the government or regulators, potentially jeopardizing our democratic values and our basic freedom of expression. Navigating this tricky balance between rules and protecting our personal freedoms is a key challenge in the digital era.</p>
<p><em>Canadian Context:</em>
In Canada, the discussion on net neutrality is intertwined with the debate over Bill C-10, also known as the Broadcasting Act. This bill, introduced in 2021, aims to update Canada’s broadcasting and telecommunications regulations to account for the digital age. Critics of Bill C-10 have expressed concerns that it could infringe on net neutrality principles by giving more power to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to regulate online content, potentially leading to restrictions on free expression and innovation.</p>
<p>In addition to Bill C-10, another significant piece of legislation to consider in the Canadian context is Bill C-18, which is also known as the Online Streaming Act. This bill, introduced to the Canadian Parliament, is designed to regulate online streaming services, potentially affecting the content and accessibility of such platforms. Critics argue that Bill C-18 could raise concerns related to net neutrality by granting the government more authority over the content available on streaming platforms and potentially infringing on free expression and access to diverse content.</p>
<p>Questions to consider:
As you view the resources in the activity below, consider the following questions:
- How does the principle of net neutrality impact the way you access and use the internet, and how might changes in net neutrality regulations affect your online experience?<br />
- What is the role of government and regulatory bodies, such as the CRTC in Canada, in ensuring a balance between net neutrality and the need to regulate online content and services?<br />
- What measures can be taken to ensure that government regulations, while addressing valid concerns, do not lead to the overreach of power and the erosion of fundamental rights, such as free speech, on the internet?<br />
- Can net neutrality coexist with the goal of ensuring high-quality internet service and fostering investment in digital infrastructure, or are these objectives inherently in conflict?</p>

</ul>
<p>Dr. Michael Geist is a law professor at the University of Ottawa where he holds the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law and is a member of the Centre for Law, Technology and Society. Browse through his <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/tech-law-topics/net-neutrality/" target="_blank">articles on Net Neutrality</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some key points of interest from Dr. Geist:
&gt; “while the focus of net neutrality is typically on telecom companies, Bill C-10 envisions a different intermediary or third party – the Canadian government via the CRTC – choosing which content Canadians see by prioritizing or de-prioritizing content that appears in Canadians’ feeds. Internet sites and services will still be available to Canadians (assuming the sites aren’t blocked given the onerous regulations), but the government’s Internet regulatory framework will mean that Internet content will not be treated in a neutral, equal fashion. The mandated Canadian content discoverability requirements will mean that a government regulator will influence what Canadians see when they access Internet services, invoking the same concerns regarding interfering with content and user choice. The intermediary may have changed, but the principle is largely the same.” (from <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2021/05/why-bill-c-10-undermines-the-governments-commitment-to-the-principle-of-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">Why Bill C-10 Undermines the Government’s Commitment to the Principle of Net Neutrality</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hard to overstate how dangerous it would be for the CRTC to be vested with new powers to regularly intervene in online content or consider “conditions of service” for Internet sites and services. While the government insists that Bill C-11 is designed for large streaming services with limited regulations, it would appear that the CRTC may have other ideas. (from <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2022/03/crtc-calls-for-more-powers-to-take-a-more-interventionist-approach-on-internet-content/" target="_blank">CRTC Calls for Increased Powers To Take a More “Interventionist” Approach on Internet Content</a> (March 3, 2022))</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“it is difficult to separate the government’s willingness to censor social media posts with its broader Internet regulation agenda, including Bills C-11, C-18 and online harms. Seeking to remove news links, mean tweets and other content without due process and without any apparent illegality does not bode well for the development of Charter-compliant regulations. The government may see itself as a model for others, but its willingness to muscle social media companies in an effort to remove lawful content is the very worst kind of example that should not be welcome in a democracy that prioritizes freedom of expression.” (from <a href="https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2023/04/government-departments-pressure-social-media-sites-to-censor-news-links-mean-tweets/" target="_blank">Government Departments Pressure Social Media Sites to Censor News Links, Mean Tweets</a> (April 13, 2023))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another interesting perspective on the issue comes from <a href="https://digitalfirstcanada.ca/fix-c11/" target="_blank">Digital First Canada</a> a non profit organization that advocates on behalf of the Digital Entrepreneurs in Canada. Here is there explanation of Bill C-11:</p>
<p>In its current form, Bill C-11 gives the CRTC authority to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dictate how and where your content appears on digital platforms.<br />
</li>
<li>Affect your discoverability by artificially promoting some creators over others. Viewers may be pushed to watch content they aren’t interested in, resulting in more skips and thumbs down, which would impact how your content is exported to global audiences, lowering viewership and revenue.<br />
</li>
<li>Apply complex “CanCon” rules that require you to prove your content is “Canadian” enough. This is easy for large Canadian media companies with teams who have been following these rules for decades, and makes it harder for smaller creators to benefit from any financial or promotional gain.<br />
</li>
<li>Push your content down in feeds if it doesn’t meet CanCon requirements.<br />
</li>
<li>Regulate the length and type of advertising on your channel, which could mean less money in your pocket.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to Digital First Canada, C-11 poses a threat to those who want to post their content online. The state the following principles:<br />
- Digital First Creators do not require government intervention to succeed. They have thrived and led a digital content renaissance without government intervention.<br />
- Digital First Creators aspire for their content to be discovered by a global audience, and do not measure success within Canada’s borders.<br />
- Freedom of expression is a fundamental freedom. Government should not interfere with or limit the ability for lawful content to be freely discovered by users.<br />
- Canadian Content designations are incompatible with user generated content, and do not benefit the interests of Digital First Creators.<br />
- Any mandatory contributions derived from user-generated content platforms must be for the benefit of Digital First Creators who make content for those platforms.</p>

<p>Case Study: <strong>Facebook Zero: Am Attempt to Bring Access to All?</strong><br />
Consider the following case study:</p>
<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Zero" target="_blank">Facebook Zero</a> is an application for mobile devices and business agreements with a number of companies to provide access to selected internet services without incurring data charges targeting markets where internet access may be less affordable. Facebook Zero is part of internet.org set up by Facebook and the basic websites than can be accessed for free without data charges are determined by the initiative.”</p>
<p>…and then some criticism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Facebook Zero became controversial in some countries due to several issues such as net neutrality. For instance, India’s Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) bans zero-rated services on account of”discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content”. A criticism also stated that Facebook is practicing digital colonialism because it is not introducing open internet but building a “little web that turns the user into a mostly passive consumer of mostly western corporate content”.”</p>

<h3>Online impersonation<a href="sharing-your-knowledge.html#online-impersonation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Impersonation online refers to the act of creating an online presence in someone else’s name. This is potentially a complex issue as some social media sites permit parody accounts or accounts that are intended to represent real individuals. It is not necessarily illegal to impersonate someone per se, for example comedy, but online impersonation is a growing problem. Many social media sites have anti-impersonation policies, but this is not sufficient guarantee or protection against the risks of online impersonation.</p>

**Digital Rights Management**

In a digital world, you may not have the full ownership rights you expect, or are accustomed to receiving in the physical world, when you buy digital content, resources, and equipment. In this section we explore digital rights management, geoblocking, and other examples. We highlight the importance users have to study the terms of reference and licenses when using proprietary software and buying products that rely on digital technology.

**Mini Challenge Summary**

**Summary:** Explore and discuss the impact of digital rights management. Time: 30–45 minutes. Consult the suggested resources and participate in the digital rights management debate.

<span class="prote">John Deere 9530 c.jpg</span>

**Digital Rights Management (DRM):** Digital rights management (DRM) describes the practice of imposing technical restrictions (hardware or software) to restrict what users can do with the digital content or operation of their equipment. 

**Examples include:**

- Film studios that embed software on their DVDs that restricts the number of copies a legal user can make to two.  
- Computer games that restrict the number of devices on which the game can be installed requiring server authentication to keep track of the number of installations.  
- e-Book publishers who restrict the ability to copy or print the materials.

**Reading**

- Layton, J. (Jan. 3, 2006). How Digital Rights Management Works. Retrieved July 4, 2017. (Click on the next button to progress the sub-pages of the article.)

**Geoblocking:** Geoblocking is a form of DRM which restricts access to content based on geographical location; for example, restrictions associated with media rights for sport coverage or films in different parts of the world because copyright holders sell broadcast and distribution rights to different companies around the world. Frequently, prices for streamed services of the same content will differ from country to country.

In another example, an individual who buys DVD films in one country and then emigrates to another country, may find that the playback of the legally purchased content is restricted by technology means in the new country of residence.

**Reading**

Geoblocking from Wikipedia;

EU lawmakers Include Spotify and iTunes in Geoblocking Ban from Reuters.

Case study - The Right to Repair

Do farmers have the right to repair their own tractors? Not necessarily, for example, John Deere’s proprietary software used to operate the vehicle does not allow “owners” to repair systems themselves and in effect they only have an implied license for life to operate the vehicle.

**Readings**

Choose one or two of the following readings (feel free to annotate using Hypothes.is and remember to tag your posts using the course code: lida102):

- We Can’t Let John Deere Destroy the Very Idea of Ownership from Wired.
- Why American Farmers are Hacking their own Tractors from the Guardian  
- A Right to Repair: Why Nebraska Farmers are Taking on John Deere and Apple from the Guardian.  
- The Fight for the “Right to Repair” from Smithsonian.com.  
- Outputs  

**Digital Rights Management Debate**

- Seeing both sides of a debate gives you the opportunity to better understand the issues. In this discussion, choose one of  

**the questions listed below and post to the DRM debate. Your post should include:**

- A sentence summarizing the issue.  
- The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is appropriate in a digital world.   
- The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is not appropriate in a digital world.  

<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider (optional)</span>

- Do you have personal experience of a DRM issue? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.  
- Do you have personal experience of a geoblocking issue? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.  
- Should owners of equipment have the right to repair? Summarize the example and present both sides of the issue.
