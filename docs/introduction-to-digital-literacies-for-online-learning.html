<h2>Overview<a href="introduction-to-digital-literacies-for-online-learning.html#overview" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Welcome to Unit 1 of Learning with Technology! This course will introduce you to some ideas related to living, learning, and working in our digitally-saturated society. It is our intent to provide you with opportunities to start your university career with an emerging set of skills and literacies related to digital tools for learning. Within your academic pursuits, you will encounter a vast amount of information, and integrating digital tools into your learning journey might be difficult. Your chosen discipline will provide ample learning possibilities, and incorporating digital tools to enhance your learning may prove challenging. This course will give you a head start on using digital tools to build a workflow that will allow you to stay organized and to make your process of learning visible for yourself and your instructors. We will also lead you through readings and thoughts about your digital identity, privacy and security, and sharing your new knowledge in ethical ways.</p>
<!--
//todo #2
-->
<p>There will be two primary branches of the course and the tools that we will show you. The first branch will be a workflow that is private to you because it takes place primarily on your own computer, and the second branch is shared as publicly as you are comfortable sharing. You will have control over how public your work is, but we will think about the importance of sharing knowledge and how to do that easily and in ways that preserve your ‘ownership’ over your work.</p>
<p>In this first unit, there will be both theoretical and practical work for you to do. In order to build a theoretical understanding of digital tools for learning, we will explore the idea of <em>the digital</em> in the context of contemporary society. At the same time, there are some important practicalites to manage in order to get set up for the course, so we will lead you through installing some apps on your computer that you will use extensively in this course, and which hopefully will become the backbone of your digital workflow throughout your time in higher education and beyond.</p>

<p>We begin Unit 1 with an introduction to the idea of <em>the digital</em>. You may recognize that digital tools are deeply embedded in modern society. It is not uncommon for people of all ages to interact with apps and tools that claim to connect people in conversations or networks, or to perform complex tasks for work, or to control various systems in our vehicles. Digital technology is really everywhere we look. Thinking about these tools is one way to conceptualize how we interact with digital tools, but we can also recognize that our social practices and norms have been impacted by digital tools. An example of this, at least in North America, is that the names of companies have become verbs. If people want to learn something about a topic, they <em>Google</em> it. Mobile phones are often essential tools for communication, social media, internet browsing, messaging, entertainment, photography, navigation, online shopping, mobile banking, productivity, and health and fitness management. In other cases, such as in social media, it is almost impossible to participate in public discourse without access to technology.</p>

rewrote this:

"It is deeper than that, though, as the COVID-19 pandemic led to many jurisdictions relying on mobile phones for allowing people to confirm their vaccination status in order to access restaurants or other public venues in the midst of restrictions creating barriers for those who don't have mobile phones."

to this: The COVID-19 pandemic underscored this digital impact, with mobile phones becoming crucial for verifying vaccination status and accessing public spaces, which created barriers for those who don't have mobile phones. 

Then I deleted it.  Do we need this reference to covid times?  It could be a trigger for so many.

-->
<p>Modern universities are also deeply impacted by <em>the digital</em>. Every system involved in higher education has been digitized in some manner, including recruitment, accounting, and fundraising. As you begin your university career, here are some digital systems you will likely encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>courses are designed and often delivered digitally,</li>
<li>course logistics (discussion forums, assignment submissions, quizzes, gradebooks) happen in large digital tools called learning management systems (LMS) or virtual learning environments (VLE) (e.g. Moodle),</li>
<li>assignments must often be created digitally (word processors, presentation software, video editors, website builders),</li>
<li>research data is gathered, stored, analyzed, and shared digitally.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other processes and procedures that rely on <em>the digital</em> in higher education, but the important thing for you to realize as you begin your higher education journey is that there are many tools that you will be required to learn and use throughout your journey. Some are more obvious, like word processors, presentation software, email, the library website, and LMSs, but some are less obvious and won’t necessarily be taught specifically, other than in this course.</p>
<p>Some of the digital tools we will introduce to you will help you build a <em>workflow</em> for you to manage the huge amount of information and resources that you will have to sort through to complete many of your assignments. You will learn to use AI to find <em>relevant</em> resources on whatever your topic might be. As you know from searching Google, a simple search of the web can turn up thousands or millions of hits, but there are tools that can help you highlight the 20 most relevant resources in just a few clicks. Once you find resources, we will show you tools that will allow you to track all your references, create citations in your writing quickly and easily, and then create a perfectly formatted reference list. Do not waste your time creating your own bibliographies! This one tool will save you days and likely weeks of work during your degree (quite literally). We will show you another tool that will allow you to make connections between ideas and notes so that you build a network of connected ideas. Curating this network of ideas is possibly one of the most useful things you can do in higher ed. You will end up with a searchable network of everything you’ve learned, and be able to visualize it at the click of a button. We will help you think through the implications of how you present yourself on the web so that you can make wise decisions about what you share and how you share it. We will also help you make connections on the web that could become a key resource for your learning and working in your career.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:diglit" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1.1  (Digital Literacy) </strong></span>Digital literacy is a person’s knowledge, skills, and abilities for using digital tools ethically, effectively, and within a variety of contexts in order to access, interpret, and evaluate information, as well as to create, construct new knowledge, and communicate with others. From <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/post-secondary-education/institution-resources-administration/digital-learning-strategy/digital_learning_strategy.pdf" target="&quot;_blank”">B.C.’s Post-Secondary Digital Learning Strategy</a></p>

<p>Literacy, as we commonly understand it, is the ability to <em>understand</em> the meaning of texts. It is more than just being able to ‘read’. In the same way, digital literacy is the ability to make meaning using digital tools. It is more than simply being able to post to Instagram or TikTok, or whatever app you might use. As the definition above indicates, digital literacy involves using tools <em>ethically</em>, to <em>access, interpret, evaluate, create, construct, and communicate</em> information and knowledge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In today’s world, being literate requires much, much more than the traditional literacy of yesterday.”
—Rebecca Alber</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What digital tools do you use to help you make meaning? What is your “go-to” app for note-taking, organizing files, tracking references, and connecting ideas? One valuable tool we are going to show you is called Obsidian, a free note-taking and mind-mapping app. Before you go through the instructions in the activity below, watch the following video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FNqEDGc8g" target="&quot;_blank”">This is Obsidian</a></p>

<h3>Activity: Getting Started with Obsidian<a href="introduction-to-digital-literacies-for-online-learning.html#activity-getting-started-with-obsidian" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<div class="reflect">
<p>Follow the steps below to install Obsidian on your computer.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to <a href="https://obsidian.md/download" target="_blank">obsidian.md</a> and <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian" target="_blank">follow these instructions to install Obsidian on your computer.</a>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended that you use a computer, rather than a mobile phone to install Obsidian, but please let your instructor or facilitator know if you are on mobile.</li>
<li>You do NOT need to purchase any upgrades such as <strong>Obsidian Sync</strong> or <strong>Obsidian Publish</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Work through the <strong>Getting Started</strong> section of the Obsidian help pages starting with <strong><a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault" target="_blank">Create a vault</a></strong>.
<ul>
<li>When you create the vault in this step, we recommend that you name it <strong>TWU</strong> or something similar. Later, you can create as many vaults as you would like.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is recommended that you <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Sync+your+notes+across+devices" target="_blank">use one of the sync services listed here</a> so that your files are backed up.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are having any difficulty in installing Obsidian, feel free to reach out for support on <a href="https://twu.discourse.group/c/ldrs101/10" target="_blank">the Learning Hub</a>. There are also several tutorials and videos online, so you are encouraged to seek out these resources. One example is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88" target="_blank">Obsidian for Beginners: Start HERE — How to Use the Obsidian App for Notes</a>. The first minute shows how to set up Obsidian…and if you’d like a sneak peek at the amazing features this tool has to offer, watch on! We’ll get to these additional uses of Obsidian later in the course.</p>
</div>
<p>Obsidian will become a backbone of this course as we will use it to learn how the web works and give you a workflow that will help you stay organized. One of the advantages of Obsidian is that everything you do in the app happens on your own computer, rather than <em>the cloud</em>, which is just another way of saying <em>someone else’s computer</em>. However, the drawback to that is that you need to ensure that you have a backup of your vaults in a secure location, either one of the sync services mentioned in step 3, above, or another backup system. <a href="https://twu.discourse.group/c/ldrs101/10" target="_blank">Please check the Learning Hub</a> or talk your your instructor or facilitator for help with this.</p>

<p>Now that you have a place to record your course notes, let’s jump back into the discussion about digital literacy. Traditionally, literacy was about speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literacy has taken on a much broader and complex meaning. Today there’s also digital literacy, media literacy, new literacy etc. In the activity below you are invited to reflect on how your literacies have changed, when compared to your parents and to speculate on new literacies the next generation of learners may need for the future.</p>

<p>Traditionally, literacy was about speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literacy has taken on a much broader and complex meaning. Today there’s also digital literacy, media literacy, new literacy etc. In this signpost you are invited to reflect on how your literacies have changed, when compared to your parents and to speculate on new literacies the next generation of learners may need for the future.</p>
<p>The following video, published by the MacArthur Foundation, questions how digital media are changing the way young people learn, play, socialize, and participate in civic life. John Seely Brown a researcher with particular interests in radical innovation and digital culture suggests that today’s gaming oriented children want to be measured and feel that if they are not learning, it is not fun. How does this relate to how you feel about learning?</p>
<p>Watch the video and think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What “literacy” skills have you acquired when compared to your parents?<br />
</li>
<li>What “literacy” skills will be important for future learners in higher education?</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Visitors and Residents<a href="introduction-to-digital-literacies-for-online-learning.html#visitors-and-residents" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>One way to start thinking about digital literacy is to create a map of the apps and tools that you use, how you use them, and what traces of your presence you leave behind on the web. We call this a <em>Visitors and Residents Diagram</em>. To complete this activity, you will need to do a little bit of setup, as follows.</p>
<p>Have you heard of the terms ‘digital natives’ and ‘digital immigrants’?</p>
<!--

Thinking of a high school, first year uni student... they may not have encountered this conversation.

It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital 'natives' and 'immigrants'.

also changing *kids these days* below and "those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet"

-->

<div class="caution">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <a href="https://marcprensky.com/">Marc Prensky</a>, who proposed this idea, is the one who thought it would be a good idea to refer to people as ‘natives’. We recognize that this term should not be used to talk about people.</p>
</div>
<p>The essential argument is that certain generations have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those generations whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to <em>kids</em>. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky’s original article.</p>
<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native">Digital native</a>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but this doesn’t imply a superior aptitude for learning technology compared to older generations or an inherent proficiency in doing so. For example, are most 1st-year university students proficient in using a spreadsheet to create a budget? If they have practiced creating a budget, it’s more likely they use an app than a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>We’d like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a <em>visitor</em> in some web spaces and a <em>resident</em> in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don’t leave a public trace of your time there. You don’t spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.</p>
<p>Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where <em>you</em> reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or X (formerly Twitter), or maybe it’s a blog, or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially <em>present</em>.</p>
<p>At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;–&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;–&gt; professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.</p>

<p>I’ve shared my VR Diagram below…keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there.</p>
<p><img src="assets/u1/vr-diagram-2.png" alt="Visitor-Resident Diagram" /></p>
<p>It is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don’t spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).</p>
<p>For many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn’t determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.</p>
<p>If you don’t already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called <em>Teaching in Higher Ed</em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/bonni208">Bonni Stachowiak</a>, or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents.</p>

***Feel free to answer the questions above in your notes or Reflective Learning Journal***. 

<span class="blockhead">Introduction to the Reflective Journaling</span>

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning.  Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings: whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your instructor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even outside of our scheduled course activities. 

<details>
<summary>**Common Questions Used for Reflective Journaling** - Click to expand</summary> 

- In your view, what were the most important points in the readings, videoclips, or discussions with your peers?  
- What information did you already know?  
- What new knowledge, ideas, or perspectives have you gained?  
- What information was easy to remember or learn? Why?  
- What concepts did you find more difficult? Why?  
- How can you apply this knowledge to your work or current experience?  
- How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience?  
- Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts?  
- Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why?  
- If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be?  
- What further questions would like to ask the author of your readings?

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Digital Privacy &amp; Safety<a href="introduction-to-digital-literacies-for-online-learning.html#digital-privacy-safety" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Now that you have assessed some of your digital skills or literacies, let’s focus our attention on privacy and safety. In this section we summarize important practices as a reminder to remain vigilant in protecting your privacy and security online. If you are unsure about good security practices, there are a wealth of online resources you can (and should) consult.</p>
<div id="privacy" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Privacy<a href="introduction-to-digital-literacies-for-online-learning.html#privacy" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Your privacy is fragile, easy to lose instantaneously, and difficult to retrieve in an environment that requires so much online interaction.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft" target="_blank"><strong>Identity theft</strong></a> happens, frequently.
<ul>
<li>Never put your social security number, your birthday, your mother’s maiden name, or any other personal facts, anywhere online. Everyone on the Internet will be able to access this information.<br />
</li>
<li>Always assume that anything you write online (including email) can, and probably will, eventually leak. Keep your email address private – to avoid receiving spam. If your email is published in a plain form anywhere online, even if it is part of an archived email list, spammers will “harvest” it for their databases.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Spam email <a href="https://securelist.com/spam-report-2019/96527/" target="_blank">(at least half of all email being sent)</a></strong> – is an unfortunate fact of our modern lives.
<ul>
<li>If you must publish your email address online, consider creating a “sacrificial” email address, or one you only use to publish online. You can create an email “alias,” which you can set to automatically forward to your primary email, and easily disable if your spam volumes increases. Many email services will automatically generate random email addresses that you can use to hide your true address.</li>
<li>Another approach is to avoid publishing the email address as something like <em><a href="mailto:myname@somewebdomain.net" class="email">myname@somewebdomain.net</a></em>… Instead you might use more confusing text, such as myname-at-somewebdomain-net. Some websites support using these types of obfuscation methods, but the spammers who “scrape” email addresses from websites to populate their spam databases use increasingly sophisticated methods to defeat these methods.<br />
</li>
<li>Basically, avoid publishing the email addresses you value online to decrease the amount of spam you receive.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="passwords" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Passwords<a href="introduction-to-digital-literacies-for-online-learning.html#passwords" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>What about passwords? Many people have just one, or maybe a few. Given the number of websites and web services which require password-based authentication, this is not good enough to avoid an identity disaster.</p>
<p>The problem with having only a few passwords is that even resource-rich and security-critical organizations have <a href="https://gizmodo.com.au/2017/05/over-560-million-passwords-discovered-in-anonymous-online-database/" target="_blank">suffered massive leaks</a>. If even one of them suffers a data leak, identity thieves will obtain your password and try to use it on other websites. It is easy for them to do this using computer technologies.</p>
<p>Other ways someone can get your password include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sniffing traffic when you log into a non-secure website that uses <a href="http://" class="uri">http://</a> rather than <a href="https://" class="uri">https://</a> – the “s” stands for secure because your data transmission’s encrypted. Look for the Lock icon.png in your address bar.<br />
</li>
<li>Sniffing emails – your email, unless encrypted, is not secure. Never send a login and password along with the web address of a service (similarly, don’t send credit card numbers).<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing" target="_blank">Phishing</a> attacks – where someone sends you an email that looks like it is from a trusted sender, such as from a friend, your bank, an online store you frequent, or a government agency, and they ask you to enter your password to confirm it. No one should ever ask you to enter your password via email.<br />
</li>
<li>Always check the web address (hover over the link) to make sure it corresponds to the right place, or call the sender to confirm the request over the phone.<br />
</li>
<li>Brute force – hackers often use computers to guess your password, beginning with a list of <a href="https://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords" target="_blank">common passwords</a>, and try different combinations until they get it right, or until the system locks them out for trying too many times.<br />
</li>
<li>“How secure is my password” sites – you should avoid these sites and never type your password into a website or email response that is not appropriate, especially when you know the sender also knows your email.<br />
</li>
<li>Once your email and any password combination are known, identity thieves will try to use them at various websites, because they know most people only use a few passwords. A thief who discovers a password you created for a website you rarely use will try to compromise the security of a website that is important to you – such as your email system, your workplace, social media accounts, or bank account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a table that shows how quickly passwords can be cracked using brute force methods. Note that the best passwords are both long and include a mix of numbers, lower-case and upper-case letters, and symbols.</p>
<p><img src="assets/u1/brute.jpg" alt="Hive’s report shows that passphrases with a mix of 18 uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols are the most difficult to brute force. Image: Hive Systems" /></p>
<p>There are services you can use to check if your email is part of a leaked password data set. So, what can you do to protect yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Password Managers</strong></p>
<p>Get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager" target="_blank">password manager</a>. They are incredibly helpful and convenient now that many of us use several computers and mobile devices. Password managers help you manage your passwords.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you choose a password manager, make sure you create one <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/" target="_blank">strong password</a>, such as a full sentence with some numbers and special characters. This is all you need to remember – the password manager remembers the others. The ensures you generate a different, fully-random password for each website you use that requires a password.<br />
</li>
<li>Good password managers only ever store your details in an encrypted form, where even the company that stores it cannot see your passwords. To access your passwords, you log into the password manager service using your single, strong password (via a secure web link – usually the default, but always check!).<br />
</li>
<li>There are many <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=password+managers&amp;bshm=rimc/1" target="_blank">password manager options</a>. Some widely used proprietary options include <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank">Lastpass</a> and <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1password</a>. Open source options also exist, such as <a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank">Bitwarden</a>. Sadly, some of the most popular password managers have suffered from software bugs that have exposed user passwords.</li>

<h4>Good Messaging Hygiene<a href="introduction-to-digital-literacies-for-online-learning.html#good-messaging-hygiene" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Always assume that anyone can and will read anything you write in an email. Email is not a secure form of communication. Few people encrypt their email, because it is an extra step that even the most technically-inclined users are reluctant to take. Both sender and recipient have to be technically proficient.</p>
<p>Text messages and instant messaging, such as Facebook messenger, are also insecure. Anyone, including government officials and the organization that runs the service, such as Facebook employees, can read it.</p>
<p><strong>Secure your Own Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Never send any sensitive data, such as your social security number, credit card number, password, or other personal information via email or text. Call the person to provide this information over the phone.</p>
<p>You can use a secure, encrypted, text message service, such as Signal if necessary. It is available at no cost, works on most platforms, and encrypts text messages on your phone. If you text someone else with Signal installed, the entire transaction is encrypted.</p>
<p><strong>Secure the Privacy of Others</strong></p>
<p>Another element of good digital hygiene is to protect the identity of others. For example, never send group emails using To: or CC: (carbon copy) for each email address. You will reveal the email addresses for everyone on your list. This is especially problematic if you or another person saves the email message and displays it on the web, such as in a mailing list archive. This makes it easy for spammers and hackers to access and download all of those email addresses.</p>
<p>Use BCC: (blind carbon copy), to hide the email addresses from your recipients, to protect everyone’s privacy. Use your own email address, and BCC the rest of the recipients, if your email software requires you to insert an email address into the To: box.</p>
<p>When using an email mailing list, where you send messages to a single email address to a list of people, never CC: someone else in the same message. This will compromise the privacy of every CC’d recipient and the privacy of the list. Always check with the people on the list to ensure you are not taking unacceptable liberties.</p>
<p>If someone asks you to share an email address of a friend or colleague, you should ask permission to share their email address, and state why the third party is requesting their email.</p>
<p><strong>Be a Thoughtful Sceptic</strong></p>
<p>So how can we protect ourselves if new threats are emerging all the time?</p>
<ul>
<li>Be conscious of where you put information that is “private” to you.<br />
</li>
<li>Beware of the terms of service of social media providers, such as Facebook. Use a service like “<a href="https://tosdr.org/" target="_blank">TOSDR</a>” to help identify risky, overreaching services. You may be able to use certain privacy settings to protect your information.<br />
</li>
<li>Always check the identity of a website before you enter any passwords or personal information. Secure certificates are generally trustworthy, but be sure check the names and details.<br />
</li>
<li>Always ask whether you should trust a provider or a government agency. Always ask “who benefits when I do this?” What are their incentives?<br />
</li>
<li>Protect your own data and be even more protective of others’ private information. For example, be cautious before posting information about yourself or someone else. Be especially cautious when posting pictures or videos of their children.<br />
</li>
<li>Remember, complacency and unwarranted trust are your biggest enemies. A healthy paranoia is good for your digital health. Think about the great amount of time and effort it will take to regain your identity (and credit rating) if your information is compromised.</li>

## Digital Privacy and Safety

In this unit we've started discussing 'the digital', you have started a blog (part of your PLN), and you've examined your own digital identity.  In our final topic, we want to begin to think and write about how to keep yourself and your information safe in digital learning environments.

So, what is digital literacy?  In the next activity, you will start to unpack this term and prepare your own initial definition of digital literacy.

### Activity: Definining Digital Literacy {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{reflect}<div class="reflect">
Purpose: Search for definitions of digital literacy and digital skills on the web to identify the difference.

1. Read Wikipedia’s definition of [Digital literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy){target="_blank"} – Is this a good description?
1. Scan the [#diglit](https://twitter.com/i/flow/login?redirect_after_login=%2Fhashtag%2Fdiglit%3Fs%3D03){target="_blank"} hashtag on X (Twitter) – Did you find any valuable links to defining digital literacy?
1. Conduct a Google search for “digital literacy.” Select a few definitions you like and record the urls, for example by adding these to your browser bookmarks.
1. Conduct a Google search for “digital skills.” Select one or two definitions you like and record the urls.
1. Conduct a Google search for “digital fluency” Select one or two definitions.
1. What are the differences between digital literacies, digital fluency, and digital skills? How are these concepts related?
1. Read: [What is digital literacy?](http://pomo.com.au/blog/digital-literacy/){target="_blank"} published by POMO – Is this a reliable source?
1. How would you rate the academic quality of the definitions you found (e.g. low / high quality)?
1. What did you discover? Share your thoughts and experiences by posting on the LDRS101 Discourse channel.  For example:

- The major difference between digital skills and literacies is …
- I didn’t realise that …
- For me, digital literacy means …”

Note: Your comment will be displayed in the course feed.

### Digital skills versus literacies

“Saying that any digital tool teaches us digital literacies is like saying a pen or a keyboard teaches us writing.”
—Maha Bali
@Bali_Maha


"Digital literacies are not solely about technical proficiency but about the issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose.”
—Doug Belshaw, Educational researcher



### Activity: Digital skills versus literacies {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{reflect}<div class="reflect">
In this activity, we will review an article on the difference between digital skills and digital literacies using Hypothes.is – an online social annotation technology.


Purpose
Read an online article and annotate it using Hypothes.is.

Tasks

1. Read the Hypothes.is “Quick start guide for students”
1. Create an account on Hypothes.is. Here is the registration link
We recommend that you use the Chrome browser (download here) and install the Hypothes.is extension. Alternatively, you can annotate web pages directly from the Hypothes.is website by pasting the link into the text area after you have logged into the site. If you are working on a mobile device, please follow these instructions: How to use Hypothes.is on mobile devices.
1. Read the following article: Knowing the Difference Between Digital Skills and Digital Literacies, and Teaching Both
1. Activate the annotations after logging in to Hypothes.is and click on the search icon () and enter the course code (LiDA101) to filter posts for this course from the public feed.
1. Annotate or reply to posts by visiting the annotation page (You will need to be logged into the Hypothes.is site to post.)
1. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS101 (The course tag is required to harvest posts for the course feed.)
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{reflect}



### Activity: Researching a definition {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{reflect}<div class="reflect">

This course is facilitated and enabled by resources that learners can access on the Internet. This involves the ability to search, evaluate, and select resources to support your learning. A key feature of a PLE is the ability to share useful and valuable information with your peers.

In this activity, you will complete your first resource bank activity, where you are invited to search for additional resources to help you refine and develop your own definition of digital literacies, and to reflect on how this differs from definitions for digital skills. The resource bank activity builds on your initial search on the previous page by inviting you to share links to valuable resources you source on the Internet. The resource bank provides the technology to share these resources with our LDRS 101 learning community.

The resource bank for this course is hosted on ...(Obsidian? Evernote? Moodle wiki? Google doc?) is an open source social bookmarking application which enables users to share and annotate links to resources they find on the web. It uses a tag system to group resources according to different topics. The tag system helps users to locate links to resources on the site using the same tag.

The purpose of this activity is to find and select online definitions for digital literacies and digital skills, and to record and share these links using the OERu resource bank. This activity is designed to give you the opportunity to familiarise yourself with our shared resource bank, which is hosted on the bookmarks.oeru.org site. Note the format of the resource bank activity; in particular, scroll down to the footnote area at the bottom of this activity to see the required and recommended tags.

Tasks

**Search**
1. Conduct a general Google search to find a few definitions for digital literacies and digital skills (narrow your search to three or four resources you find valuable for both concepts.)

### Activity: Forum – Why digital literacy matters {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{reflect}<div class="reflect">
A key component of digital literacy and networked learning relates to the ability to engage meaningfully in online learning communities.

This learning activity will provide you with the opportunity to familiarise yourself with the Moodle discussion boards that are common in TWU online learning discussions.

Purpose of discussion activity:
To reflect on the reasons why digital literacy matters to you, and to demonstrate your digital skills using a discussion forum.

TWU online courses often use Moodle discussion forums as the main discussion platform for learners to engage in course conversations asyncrhonously. 

- info re oeru forums - replace with Discourse?
This is a community managed platform using the open source Discourse software. The system awards badges for a range of activities. Authentic activity increases the user’s trust levels which will enable more software features for participants as your trust levels increase over time. Therefore it’s a good time to get started in earning your first badges and improving your trust levels early in the course.

Watch the following video and jot down the reasons why digital literacy matters to you, then complete the steps which follow.

(Watch: *Digital literacy and why it matters*)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2k3C-iB88w]{target="_blank"}

**Steps**

1. Log in to forums.oeru.org (Sign up to register a new account if your don’t already have one.)  
1. Complete your profile page (Click on your user icon on the top right-hand side of your screen and select the settings cog).  
1. Spend a few minutes to explore the badges you can earn on the discourse platform. (Click on the badge for details.) By the end of this learning pathway you should have attained the following badges:  
   - Autobiographer  
   - First-like  
   - First mention  
   - First quote  
1. Post a contribution to the discussion on digital literacies and why they are important for you  
1. Remember to post one or two replies to interesting contributions (You should also “like” good contributions, use @username when replying, and if appropriate quote a reply when responding.)  
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{reflect}

### Assessment and scope of digital literacies {-}

Digital literacies for academic learning involves more than Facebook, Snapchat or Twitter and the associated technical skills in using these technologies. 

As you explore the concept, you will find online resources which confuse digital skills with digital literacies. The activities which follow aim to provide an initial introduction to the wide range of digital literacies associated with academic learning. We will explore the concept of digital literacies in greater depth as we progress with the course. When exploring these online resources, we encourage you to differentiate between skills and literacies and to develop a critical disposition. Digtial literacies involve issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose. However, these literacies are closely related to technical proficiency in using a range of digital applications

### Activity: Am I Digitally Literate? {-}

\BeginKnitrBlock{reflect}<div class="reflect">
Digital literacies encompasses a wide range of capabilities which extend beyond the digital skills associated with different technologies.

1. Study the graphic depicting the Seven elements of digital literacies (scroll down the page to view the graphic). (replace)  
1. Jot down one or more technologies or tools you would recommend for each of the seven elements in the graphic and assess your competence in using each particular technology/tool (eg below average, average, above average and excellent).  
1. Next, use your searching skills to discover the range and scope of digital literacies (Don’t spend more than 15 to 20 minutes on the self-assessment activity).  
   - Conduct a Google search using: “digital literacy self-assessment”  
   - Choose a link to conduct a self-assessment of your digital literacy.  
   - **Alternatively, you can:**  
   - Try the iTest developed by the University of Exeter **or**  
   - Explore the What is digital literacy? page of the Digital Literacies Toolkit developed by the University of Southampton.  

<span class="blockhead">Questions to consider</span>

- Did the self-assessment you chose focus on digital skills or digital literacies?
- What did you learn from this exercise?
- Share your thoughts by posting on Discourse:

**Note:** Your comment will be displayed in the course feed.
