## 1.3 Digital Literacies {.unnumbered}

> Digital literacy is a person's knowledge, skills, and abilities for using digital tools ethically, effectively, and within a variety of contexts in order to access, interpret, and evaluate information, as well as to create, construct new knowledge, and communicate with others. (Government of British Columbia, n.d., p. 23)

Literacy, as we commonly understand it, is the ability to *understand* the meaning of texts. It is more than just being able to read. In the same way, digital literacy is the ability to make meaning using digital tools. It is more than simply being able to post to Instagram or TikTok, or whatever app you might use. As the definition above indicates, digital literacy involves using tools *ethically*, to *access, interpret, evaluate, create, construct, and communicate* information and knowledge.

> "In today's world, being literate requires much, much more than the traditional literacy of yesterday." (Alber, 2013)

What digital tools do you use to help you make meaning? What is your "go-to" app for note taking, organizing files, tracking references, and connecting ideas? One valuable tool we are going to show you is called Obsidian, a free note taking and mind mapping app. Before you go through the instructions in the activity below, watch the video *This is Obsidian*. (2021).

<!--
-   Go to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/download){target="_blank"} and [follow these instructions to install Obsidian on your computer.](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian){target="_blank"}
    -   It is recommended that you use a computer rather than a mobile phone to install Obsidian, but please let your instructor or facilitator know if you are on mobile.
    -   You do NOT need to purchase any upgrades such as **Obsidian Sync** or **Obsidian Publish**.
-   Work through the **Getting Started** section of the Obsidian help pages starting with **Create a vault**.
    -   When you create the vault in this step, we recommend that you name it **TWU** or something similar. Later, you can create as many vaults as you would like.
-   It is recommended that you use one of the sync services listed here so that your files are backed up.

If you are having any difficulty in installing Obsidian, feel free to reach out for support on [the Learning Hub](https://twu.discourse.group/auth/microsoft_office365){target="_blank"}. There are also several tutorials and videos online; you are encouraged to seek out these resources. One example is [*Obsidian for Beginners: Start HERE --- How to Use the Obsidian App for Notes*](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QgbLb6QCK88?si=ZKdRBBIccDy4TjgY){target="_blank"} (2020). The first minute shows how to set up Obsidian ... and if you'd like a sneak peek at the amazing features this tool has to offer, watch on! We'll get to these additional uses of Obsidian later in the course.

```
::::

Obsidian will become a backbone of this course as we will use it to learn how the web works and give you a workflow that will help you stay organized. One of the advantages of Obsidian is that everything you do in the app happens on your own computer, rather than the cloud, which is just another way of saying *someone else's computer*. However, the drawback to that is that you need to ensure that you have a backup of your vaults in a secure location, either one of the sync services mentioned in Step 3, above, or another backup system. [Please check the Learning Hub](https://twu.discourse.group/auth/microsoft_office365){target="_blank"} or talk to your instructor or facilitator for help with this.

Now that you have a place to record your course notes, let's jump back into the discussion about digital literacy. Traditionally, literacy was about speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literacy has taken on a much broader and complex meaning. Today there's also digital literacy, media literacy, new literacy, and so on. In the activity below you are invited to reflect on how technology, and the literacies needed to navigate technology, have changed over the years, and to speculate on new literacies the next generation of learners may need for the future.

{{< video https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PdqWlByz-NQ >}}

While you watch the video think about:

-   What digital literacy skills have you acquired compared to skills that were needed 50 years ago? How about 10 years ago?
-   What digital literacy skills will be important for future learners in higher education? For future workers?

Reflect on the following writing prompts:

-   My parents did not need to ...
-   A new literacy I acquired is the ability to ...
-   Higher education students of the future will need to ...
-   ... is an important 21st century skill for future employment

To complete this activity, click "Open Today's Daily Note" in your Obsidian vault and write your reflections. This is the start of your reflective learning journal that you will continue to add to throughout the course.

#### Digital Literacies and Skills {.unnumbered}

Digital literacies for academic learning involves more than Facebook, Snapchat, or X (Twitter) and the associated technical skills in using these technologies.

As you explore the concept, you will find online resources which confuse digital skills with digital literacies. The activities which follow aim to provide an initial introduction to the wide range of digital literacies associated with academic learning. We will explore the concept of digital literacies in greater depth as we progress with the course. When exploring these online resources we encourage you to differentiate between skills and literacies, and to develop a critical disposition. Digital literacies involve issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose. However, these literacies are closely related to technical proficiency in using a range of digital applications.

In the next activity, you will start to unpack these terms and prepare your own initial definition of digital literacy.

### 1.3.4 Activity: Defining Digital Literacy {.unnumbered}

:::: {.learning-activity time="30"}
Let's take a look at the definitions of digital literacy and digital skills on the web and identify the difference. Follow the steps below and feel free to jot down some notes in your Obsidian journal. If you are completing this activity on a new day, create a new daily note.

-   Read [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy){target="_blank"} (2024) of digital literacy---is this a good description?
-   Scan the #diglit or #digital-literacy hashtags on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/home){target="_blank"} --- did you find any valuable links to defining digital literacy?
-   Conduct a Google search for "digital literacy." Select a few definitions you like and record their URLs, for example by adding these to your browser bookmarks.
-   Conduct a Google search for "digital skills." Select one or two definitions you like and record the URLs.
-   Conduct a Google search for "digital fluency." Select one or two definitions.
-   What are the differences between digital literacies, digital fluency, and digital skills? How are these concepts related?
-   How would you rate the academic quality of the definitions you found (e.g., low or high quality)?
-   What did you discover?

Next, read the [*Quick Guide - Developing Students' Digital Literacy*](assets/u1/JISC_REPORT_Digital_Literacies_280714_PRINT.pdf){target="_blank"} (n.d.)

This guide defines digital literacies as "the capabilities which fit an individual for living, learning and working in a digital society (n.d., Introduction)." Furthermore, this report distinguishes between seven elements of digital literacies:

:::

### 1.3.6 Activity: Am I Digitally Literate? {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="20"}
Digital literacy encompasses a wide range of capabilities which extend beyond the digital skills associated with different technologies. Consider the digital literacies you identified from the previous activity.

-   Jot down one or more technologies or tools you would recommend for each of the skills and assess your competence in using each particular technology or tool (e.g., below average, average, above average, or excellent).
-   Next, use your searching skills to discover online tests for assessing your digital literacies (don't spend more than 15 to 20 minutes on the self-assessment activity).
    -   Conduct a Google search using "digital literacy self-assessment"
    -   Choose a link to conduct a self-assessment of your digital literacy

Alternatively, you can choose from these resources:

-   Take the [Digital Literacy Self-Assessment](https://www.supportedemployment.ca/digital-literacy/digital-literacy-self-assessment/){target="_blank"} (n.d.) from the Canadian Association for Supported Employment **or**
-   Use the [Digital Literacy Self-Assessment Tool](https://thinkspace.csu.edu.au/digitalcitizenshipguideetl523/){target="_blank"} (2020) from the Digital Citizenship Guide **or**
-   Explore the *What is Digital Literacy?* page of the [Digital Literacies Toolkit](https://www.elanguages.ac.uk/digital_literacies_toolkit.php){target="_blank"} (n.d.) developed by the University of Southampton.

**Questions to Consider**:

-   Did the self-assessment you chose focus on digital skills or digital literacies?
-   What did you learn from this exercise?

#### Visitors and Residents {.unnumbered}

One way to start thinking about digital literacy is to create a map of the apps and tools that you use, how you use them, and what traces of your presence you leave behind on the web. We call this a Visitors and Residents Diagram. To complete this activity, we'll first discuss some key concepts.

Have you encountered the terms "digital natives" and "digital immigrants?" What are your initial thoughts on their definitions?

::: {.note icon="true"}
Note: [Marc Prensky](https://marcprensky.com/){target="_blank"} coined the terms "digital natives" and "digital immigrants." We recognize that the term "native" should not be used to talk about people.
:::

The essential argument is that certain generations have changed, in that they have an innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those generations whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to *kids*. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky's original article.

<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native">Digital native</a>

```{=html}
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
```

Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that young people are comfortable using social media apps such as TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but this doesn't imply a superior aptitude for learning technology compared to older generations, or an inherent proficiency in doing so. For example, are most first-year university students proficient in using a spreadsheet to create a budget? If they have created a budget, it's more likely they use an app than a spreadsheet.

We'd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a *visitor* in some web spaces and a *resident* in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you quite literally visit, but importantly, don't leave a public trace of your time there. You don't spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.

Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web where *you* reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook or Instagram, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or X (formerly Twitter), or maybe it's a blog, or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people, where you are socially *present*.

At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor $\leftrightarrow$ resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal $\updownarrow$ professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to four quadrants where you might situate your technology use.

### 1.3.7 Activity: Where Am I Online? {.unnumbered}

Now to the task of creating your own Visitors and Residents Diagram.

See the diagram below ... keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that its creator has been using for a decade or more, and that they have invested their career in educational technology. There is a lot here; yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. Or perhaps your diagram has a plethora of tools you use regularly. The key idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about which tools you may have tried or are interested in pursuing. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us the opportunity to reside there.

::: {#fig-vrxdiagramx2}
![](assets/u1/vr-diagram-2.png){.lightbox fig-alt="Example of a Visitor--Resident diagram including many online tools" fig-align="left"}

Visitor--Resident Diagram
:::

It is certainly notable that this diagram's creator is very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that they don't spend much time there, they spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that they do there leaves very little trace of their personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image, and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).

For many university students, a Learning Management System (LMS) like Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and they feel comfortable accessing course materials, finding their grades, communicating with classmates, and so on. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn't determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.

### 1.3.8 Activity: Create a Visitor and Resident Diagram {.unnumbered}

:::: {.learning-activity time="30"}
This activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with each other. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? How do these tools impact your learning?

-   Read [*Visitors and Residents: A New Typology for Online Engagement*](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3171){target="_blank"} (2011)
-   Create a new canvas in your Obsidian vault and create your own Visitor--Resident Diagram. We have created a sample diagram in the vault.

## Digital Privacy and Safety

Now that you have assessed some of your digital skills or literacies, let's focus our attention on privacy and safety. In this section we summarize important practices as a reminder to remain vigilant in protecting your privacy and security online. If you are unsure about good security practices, there are a wealth of online resources you can (and should) consult.

#### Privacy {.unnumbered}

Your privacy is fragile, easy to lose instantaneously, and difficult to retrieve in an environment that requires so much online interaction.

-   [**Identity theft**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft){target="_blank"} happens, frequently.
    -   Never put your social insurance number, your birthday, your mother's maiden name, or any other personal facts anywhere online. Everyone on the internet will be able to access this information.
    -   Always assume that anything you write online (including email) can, and probably will, eventually leak. Keep your email address private---to avoid receiving spam. If your email is published in a plain form anywhere online, even if it is part of an archived email list, spammers will "harvest" it for their databases.
-   **Spam email [(at least half of all email being sent)](https://securelist.com/spam-report-2019/96527/){target="_blank"}** is an unfortunate fact of our modern lives.
    -   If you must publish your email address online, consider creating a "sacrificial" email address, or one you only use to publish online. You can create an email "alias" which you can set to automatically forward to your primary email, and easily disable if your spam volumes increases. Many email services will automatically generate random email addresses that you can use to hide your true address.
    -   Another approach is to avoid publishing the email address as something like *mailto:myname\@somewebdomain.net*. Instead, you might use more confusing text, such as myname-at-somewebdomain-net. Some websites support using these types of obfuscation methods, but the spammers who "scrape" email addresses from websites to populate their spam databases use increasingly sophisticated methods to defeat these methods.
    -   Basically, avoid publishing the email addresses you value online to decrease the amount of spam you receive.

#### Passwords {.unnumbered}

What about passwords? Many people have just one, or maybe a few. Given the number of websites and web services which require password-based authentication, this is not good enough to avoid an identity disaster.

The problem with having only a few passwords is that even resource-rich and security-critical organizations have [suffered massive leaks](https://gizmodo.com.au/2017/05/over-560-million-passwords-discovered-in-anonymous-online-database/){target="_blank"}. If even one of them suffers a data leak, identity thieves will obtain your password and try to use it on other websites. It is easy for them to do this using computer technologies.

Other ways someone can get your password include:

-   Sniffing traffic when you log in to a nonsecure website that uses http:// rather than https:// (the "s" stands for secure because your data transmission's encrypted). Look for the Lock icon.png in your address bar.
-   Sniffing emails---your email, unless encrypted, is not secure. Never send a login and password along with the web address of a service (similarly, don't send credit card numbers).
-   [Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing){target="_blank"} attacks---where someone sends you an email that looks like it is from a trusted sender, such as from a friend, your bank, an online store you frequent, or a government agency, and asks you to enter your password to confirm it. No one should ever ask you to enter your password via email.
-   Always check the web address (hover over the link) to make sure it corresponds to the right place or call the sender to confirm the request over the phone.
-   Brute force---hackers often use computers to guess your password, beginning with a list of [common passwords](https://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords){target="_blank"}, and try different combinations until they get it right, or until the system locks them out for trying too many times.
-   "How secure is my password" sites---you should avoid these sites and never type your password into a website or email response that is not appropriate, especially when you know the sender also knows your email.
-   Once your email and any password combination are known, identity thieves will try to use them at various websites, because they know most people only use a few passwords. A thief who discovers a password you created for a website you rarely use will try to compromise the security of a website that is important to you such as your email system, your workplace, social media accounts, or bank account.

Here is a table that shows how quickly passwords can be cracked using brute force methods. Note that the best passwords are both long and include a mix of numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and symbols.

::: {#fig-brute}

*Source* From "Are Your Passwords in the Green in 2023?," by C. Nesky, 2023, *Hive Systems* (https://www.hivesystems.com/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green-2023). Copyright 2024 [Hive Systems](https://www.hivesystems.com/){target="_blank"}. Reprinted with permission.

There are services you can use to check if your email is part of a leaked password data set. So, what can you do to protect yourself?

#### Password Managers {.unnumbered}

Get a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager){target="_blank"}. They are incredibly helpful and convenient now that many of us use several computers and mobile devices. Password managers help you manage your passwords.

-   When you choose a password manager make sure you create one [strong password](https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/){target="_blank"}, such as a full sentence with some numbers and special characters. This is all you need to remember---the password manager remembers the others. The ensures you generate a different, fully random password for each website you use that requires a password.
-   Good password managers only ever store your details in an encrypted form, where even the company that stores it cannot see your passwords. To access your passwords, you log into the password manager service using your single, strong password (via a secure web link---usually the default, but always check!).
-   There are many [password manager options](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=password+managers&bshm=rimc/1){target="_blank"}. Some widely used proprietary options include [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/){target="_blank"} and [1password](https://1password.com/){target="_blank"}. Open source options also exist, such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/){target="_blank"}. Sadly, some of the most popular password managers have suffered from software bugs that have exposed user passwords.

### 1.3.9 Activity: Get a Password Manager {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="20"}
If you don't already use a password manager, set up an account with [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/){target="_blank"}, [1password](https://1password.com/){target="_blank"}, or the free password manager, [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/){target="_blank"}, to familiarize yourself with how password managers work.

1.  Read [*How to Start Using a Password Manager*](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-start-using-password-manager/){target="_blank"} (2021).
2.  Create an account on the password manager site and establish a master password (conduct an online search for advice on choosing a secure master password).
3.  Install the browser extension for your local browser.
4.  Choose one of the TWU course websites and set up a new secure password using your password manager.
5.  Log out of the TWU course website and log in again using the password manager.
6.  Install the mobile phone app for your operating system, and desktop application for your computer (if this applies). Synchronize the local app with your online vault.

Consider using the password manager for your online accounts so you can easily set up and maintain a unique password for each online account you use.
:::

#### Good Messaging Hygiene {.unnumbered}

Always assume that anyone can and will read anything you write in an email. Email is not a secure form of communication. Few people encrypt their email because it is an extra step that even the most technically inclined users are reluctant to take. Both sender and recipient have to be technically proficient.

Text messages and instant messaging programs such as Facebook Messenger are also insecure. Anyone, including government officials and the organization that runs the service, such as Facebook employees, can read it.

#### Secure Your Own Privacy {.unnumbered}

Never send any sensitive data such as your social insurance number, credit card number, password, or other personal information via email or text. Call the person to provide this information over the phone.

You can use a secure, encrypted text message service such as Signal if necessary. It is available at no cost, works on most platforms, and encrypts text messages on your phone. If you text someone else with Signal installed, the entire transaction is encrypted.

#### Secure the Privacy of Others {.unnumbered}

Another element of good digital hygiene is to protect the identity of others. For example, never send group emails using To: or CC: (carbon copy) for each email address. You will reveal the email addresses for everyone on your list. This is especially problematic if you or another person saves the email message and displays it on the web, such as in a mailing list archive. This makes it easy for spammers and hackers to access and download all of those email addresses.

Use BCC: (blind carbon copy), to hide the email addresses from your recipients to protect everyone's privacy. Use your own email address, and BCC the rest of the recipients, if your email software requires you to insert an email address into the To: box.

When using an email mailing list where you send messages to a single email address to a list of people, never CC: someone else in the same message. This will compromise the privacy of every CC'd recipient and the privacy of the list. Always check with the people on the list to ensure you are not taking unacceptable liberties.

If someone asks you to share an email address of a friend or colleague you should ask permission to share their email address, and state why the third party is requesting their email.

#### Be a Thoughtful Sceptic {.unnumbered}

So how can we protect ourselves if new threats are emerging all the time?

-   Be conscious of where you put information that is "private" to you.
-   Beware of the terms of service (ToS) of social media providers such as Facebook. Use a service such as [*Terms of Service: Didn't Read* (TOSDR)](https://tosdr.org/){target="_blank"} to help identify risky, overreaching services. You may be able to use certain privacy settings to protect your information.
-   Always check the identity of a website before you enter any passwords or personal information. Secure certificates are generally trustworthy but be sure to check the names and details.
-   Always ask whether you should trust a provider or a government agency. Always ask "who benefits when I do this?" What are their incentives?
-   Protect your own data and be even more protective of others' private information. For example, be cautious before posting information about yourself or someone else. Be especially cautious when posting pictures or videos of their children.
-   Remember, complacency and unwarranted trust are your biggest enemies. A healthy paranoia is good for your digital health. Think about the great amount of time and effort it will take to regain your identity (and credit rating) if your information is compromised.

### 1.3.9 Activity: Analyzing Terms of Service (Didn't Read) {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="20"}
Use the [*Terms of Service: Didn't Read*](https://tosdr.org/){target="_blank"} [@TermsServiceDidn] site to look up each of the apps we will learn in this course. Each tool currently has its own file in your Obsidian vault with a template ready to go for you. Fill out the template for each tool based on what is available on tosdr.org and your own examination of the ToS for each tool.

Feel free to add components to the template. Note we're return to this website at the end of Unit 4 as we evaluate digital tools.

### 1.3.10 Activity: Introduction To Reflective Journaling {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="10"}
For the final activity of Unit 1 you will be asked to write a reflective journal entry in Obsidian on the topic of digital literacy. This entry can be used as part of **Assignment 1: Reflective Journal**.

Prior to completing this activity, let's discuss the practice of writing in a Reflective Journal.

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings---whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course's readings, activities, and discussions. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even beyond the prompting in course activities.

{{< video https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QoI67VeE3ds >}}

Here are some common questions used for reflective journaling. As you read them, consider what you have learned in this first unit.

-   In your view, what were the most important points in the readings or activities?
-   What information did you already know? What skills did you already have?
-   What new knowledge, skills, or perspectives have you gained?
-   What information was easy to remember or learn? Why?
-   What concepts or skills did you find more difficult? Why?
-   How can you apply this knowledge to your studies or future career?
-   How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience?
-   Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts?
-   Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why?
-   If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be?
-   What further questions would like to ask about the concepts presented in this unit?
-   What other concepts, resources or discussions would be of interest?

    -   Describe what digital literacies mean for you in a sentence.
    -   Ensure that your references are cited appropriately.
2.  Create a link to your VR diagram map in your entry.
3.  Summarize an action plan for improving your digital literacies
    -   Identify the literacies you plan to improve, including the reasons why and how you aim to achieve this.
