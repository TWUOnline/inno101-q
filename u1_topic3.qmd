## 1.3 Digital Literacies {.unnumbered}

> Digital literacy is a person's knowledge, skills, and abilities for using digital tools ethically, effectively, and within a variety of contexts in order to access, interpret, and evaluate information, as well as to create, construct new knowledge, and communicate with others. (Government of British Columbia, n.d., p. 23)

Literacy, as we commonly understand it, is the ability to *understand* the meaning of texts. It is more than just being able to read. In the same way, digital literacy is the ability to make meaning using digital tools. It is more than simply being able to post to Instagram or TikTok, or whatever app you might use. As the definition above indicates, digital literacy involves using tools *ethically*, to *access, interpret, evaluate, create, construct, and communicate* information and knowledge.

> "In today's world, being literate requires much, much more than the traditional literacy of yesterday." (Alber, 2013)

What digital tools do you use to help you make meaning? What is your "go-to" app for note taking, organizing files, tracking references, and connecting ideas? One valuable tool we are going to show you is called Obsidian, a free note taking and mind mapping app. Before you go through the instructions in the activity below, watch the video *This is Obsidian*. (2021).

<!--
-   Go to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/download){target="_blank"} and [follow these instructions to install Obsidian on your computer.](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Download+and+install+Obsidian){target="_blank"}
    -   It is recommended that you use a computer rather than a mobile phone to install Obsidian, but please let your instructor or facilitator know if you are on mobile.
    -   You do NOT need to purchase any upgrades such as **Obsidian Sync** or **Obsidian Publish**.
-   Work through the **Getting Started** section of the Obsidian help pages starting with **Create a vault**.
    -   When you create the vault in this step, we recommend that you name it **TWU** or something similar. Later, you can create as many vaults as you would like.
-   It is recommended that you use one of the sync services listed here so that your files are backed up.

If you are having any difficulty in installing Obsidian, feel free to reach out for support on [the Learning Hub](https://twu.discourse.group/auth/microsoft_office365){target="_blank"}. There are also several tutorials and videos online; you are encouraged to seek out these resources. One example is [*Obsidian for Beginners: Start HERE --- How to Use the Obsidian App for Notes*](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QgbLb6QCK88?si=ZKdRBBIccDy4TjgY){target="_blank"} (2020). The first minute shows how to set up Obsidian ... and if you'd like a sneak peek at the amazing features this tool has to offer, watch on! We'll get to these additional uses of Obsidian later in the course.

::::

Obsidian will become a backbone of this course as we will use it to learn how the web works and give you a workflow that will help you stay organized. One of the advantages of Obsidian is that everything you do in the app happens on your own computer, rather than the cloud, which is just another way of saying *someone else's computer*. However, the drawback to that is that you need to ensure that you have a backup of your vaults in a secure location, either one of the sync services mentioned in Step 3, above, or another backup system. [Please check the Learning Hub](https://twu.discourse.group/auth/microsoft_office365){target="_blank"} or talk to your instructor or facilitator for help with this.

Now that you have a place to record your course notes, let's jump back into the discussion about digital literacy. Traditionally, literacy was about speaking, listening, reading and writing. Literacy has taken on a much broader and complex meaning. Today there's also digital literacy, media literacy, new literacy, and so on. In the activity below you are invited to reflect on how technology, and the literacies needed to navigate technology, have changed over the years, and to speculate on new literacies the next generation of learners may need for the future.

{{< video https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PdqWlByz-NQ >}}

While you watch the video think about:

-   What digital literacy skills have you acquired compared to skills that were needed 50 years ago? How about 10 years ago?
-   What digital literacy skills will be important for future learners in higher education? For future workers?

Reflect on the following writing prompts:

-   My parents did not need to ...
-   A new literacy I acquired is the ability to ...
-   Higher education students of the future will need to ...
-   ... is an important 21st century skill for future employment

To complete this activity, click "Open Today's Daily Note" in your Obsidian vault and write your reflections. This is the start of your reflective learning journal that you will continue to add to throughout the course.

#### Digital Literacies and Skills {.unnumbered}

Digital literacies for academic learning involves more than Facebook, Snapchat, or X (Twitter) and the associated technical skills in using these technologies.

As you explore the concept, you will find online resources which confuse digital skills with digital literacies. The activities which follow aim to provide an initial introduction to the wide range of digital literacies associated with academic learning. We will explore the concept of digital literacies in greater depth as we progress with the course. When exploring these online resources we encourage you to differentiate between skills and literacies, and to develop a critical disposition. Digital literacies involve issues, norms, and habits of mind surrounding technologies used for a particular purpose. However, these literacies are closely related to technical proficiency in using a range of digital applications.

In the next activity, you will start to unpack these terms and prepare your own initial definition of digital literacy.

### 1.3.4 Activity: Defining Digital Literacy {.unnumbered}

:::: {.learning-activity time="30"}
Let's take a look at the definitions of digital literacy and digital skills on the web and identify the difference. Follow the steps below and feel free to jot down some notes in your Obsidian journal. If you are completing this activity on a new day, create a new daily note.

-   Read [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy){target="_blank"} (2024) of digital literacy---is this a good description?
-   Scan the #diglit or #digital-literacy hashtags on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/home){target="_blank"} --- did you find any valuable links to defining digital literacy?
-   Conduct a Google search for "digital literacy." Select a few definitions you like and record their URLs, for example by adding these to your browser bookmarks.
-   Conduct a Google search for "digital skills." Select one or two definitions you like and record the URLs.
-   Conduct a Google search for "digital fluency." Select one or two definitions.
-   What are the differences between digital literacies, digital fluency, and digital skills? How are these concepts related?
-   How would you rate the academic quality of the definitions you found (e.g., low or high quality)?
-   What did you discover?

Next, read the [*Quick Guide - Developing Students' Digital Literacy*](assets/u1/JISC_REPORT_Digital_Literacies_280714_PRINT.pdf){target="_blank"} (n.d.)

This guide defines digital literacies as "the capabilities which fit an individual for living, learning and working in a digital society (n.d., Introduction)." Furthermore, this report distinguishes between seven elements of digital literacies:

:::

### 1.3.6 Activity: Am I Digitally Literate? {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="20"}
Digital literacy encompasses a wide range of capabilities which extend beyond the digital skills associated with different technologies. Consider the digital literacies you identified from the previous activity.

-   Jot down one or more technologies or tools you would recommend for each of the skills and assess your competence in using each particular technology or tool (e.g., below average, average, above average, or excellent).
-   Next, use your searching skills to discover online tests for assessing your digital literacies (don't spend more than 15 to 20 minutes on the self-assessment activity).
    -   Conduct a Google search using "digital literacy self-assessment"
    -   Choose a link to conduct a self-assessment of your digital literacy

Alternatively, you can choose from these resources:

-   Take the [Digital Literacy Self-Assessment](https://www.supportedemployment.ca/digital-literacy/digital-literacy-self-assessment/){target="_blank"} (n.d.) from the Canadian Association for Supported Employment **or**
-   Use the [Digital Literacy Self-Assessment Tool](https://thinkspace.csu.edu.au/digitalcitizenshipguideetl523/){target="_blank"} (2020) from the Digital Citizenship Guide **or**
-   Explore the *What is Digital Literacy?* page of the [Digital Literacies Toolkit](https://www.elanguages.ac.uk/digital_literacies_toolkit.php){target="_blank"} (n.d.) developed by the University of Southampton.

**Questions to Consider**:

-   Did the self-assessment you chose focus on digital skills or digital literacies?
-   What did you learn from this exercise?

#### Visitors and Residents {.unnumbered}

One way to start thinking about digital literacy is to create a map of the apps and tools that you use, how you use them, and what traces of your presence you leave behind on the web. We call this a Visitors and Residents Diagram. To complete this activity, we'll first discuss some key concepts.

Have you encountered the terms "digital natives" and "digital immigrants?" What are your initial thoughts on their definitions?

::: {.note icon="true"}
Note: [Marc Prensky](https://marcprensky.com/){target="_blank"} coined the terms "digital natives" and "digital immigrants." We recognize that the term "native" should not be used to talk about people.
:::

The essential argument is that certain generations have changed, in that they have an innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those generations whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to *kids*. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky's original article.

<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native">Digital native</a>

```{=html}
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
```

Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that young people are comfortable using social media apps such as TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but this doesn't imply a superior aptitude for learning technology compared to older generations, or an inherent proficiency in doing so. For example, are most first-year university students proficient in using a spreadsheet to create a budget? If they have created a budget, it's more likely they use an app than a spreadsheet.

We'd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a *visitor* in some web spaces and a *resident* in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you quite literally visit, but importantly, don't leave a public trace of your time there. You don't spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.

Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web where *you* reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook or Instagram, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or X (formerly Twitter), or maybe it's a blog, or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people, where you are socially *present*.

At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor $\leftrightarrow$ resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal $\updownarrow$ professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to four quadrants where you might situate your technology use.

### 1.3.7 Activity: Where Am I Online? {.unnumbered}

Now to the task of creating your own Visitors and Residents Diagram.

See the diagram below ... keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that its creator has been using for a decade or more, and that they have invested their career in educational technology. There is a lot here; yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. Or perhaps your diagram has a plethora of tools you use regularly. The key idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about which tools you may have tried or are interested in pursuing. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us the opportunity to reside there.

::: {#fig-vrxdiagramx2}
![](assets/u1/vr-diagram-2.png){.lightbox fig-alt="Example of a Visitor--Resident diagram including many online tools" fig-align="left"}

Visitor--Resident Diagram
:::

It is certainly notable that this diagram's creator is very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that they don't spend much time there, they spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that they do there leaves very little trace of their personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image, and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).

For many university students, a Learning Management System (LMS) like Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and they feel comfortable accessing course materials, finding their grades, communicating with classmates, and so on. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn't determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.

### 1.3.8 Activity: Create a Visitor and Resident Diagram {.unnumbered}

:::: {.learning-activity time="30"}
This activity will help you think about how the tools we use shape and sometimes determine the nature of our interactions with each other. Do the tools you use fall on the visitor or the resident end of your continuum? How do these tools impact your learning?

-   Read [*Visitors and Residents: A New Typology for Online Engagement*](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3171){target="_blank"} (2011)
-   Create a new canvas in your Obsidian vault and create your own Visitor--Resident Diagram. We have created a sample diagram in the vault.

::: note
This diagram can be used to demonstrate your understanding of the course learning outcomes. See the Assessment tab in Moodle for how this activity relates to the assessments in this course*.*
