In this topic we consider how changes in technology have and will continue to impact digital practices in the workplace.  Pause and consider the following questions:

- How do professionals in your field of interest network online?  
- How has technology  changed business practices in your field of interest or career?
- What are the implications for learning and skills development in your future career precipitated by changes in digital technology?

### Activity: The Future of Work {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this short video, [Ken Steele](http://eduvation.ca/bio/) from Eduvation speculates about the future of the labour market and the value of higher education in a digital age.

### Technology and Change {-}

Throughout history, there are technologies which have influenced change in society. Consider for example, the invention of the steam engine and its contribution to the Industrial Revolution. In more recent times, the advent of digital photography displaced Kodachrome (at one time, the market leader in colour film sales) which ceased production in 2009.

### Artificial Intelligence {-}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to have a significant impact on society and business. Examples include, autonomous cars, computers understanding human speech and machine learning. Consider for instance, that computer chess games available for commercial desktop machines have the ability to beat accomplished chess players including grand masters.  And of course, Chat GPT.  

In this section we introduce a few interesting examples of artificial intelligence to provide a sense of how sophisticated these technologies are becoming.

First, let's define AI:

> "The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages" ([Oxford Reference](https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095426960))

> "The capacity of a computer to perform operations analogous to learning and decision making in humans, as by an expert system, a program for CAD or CAM, or a program for the perception and recognition of shapes in computer vision systems" ([Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/artificial-intelligence))

What is your experience with AI?  Have you used an AI tool, such as Grammerly or ChatGPT? How has this technology affected you as a student, and what effect do you think it has/will have on your chosen profession?  

In the next activity, we'll explore some of these questions and concerns.


### Activity: How Can I Use AI as a Student? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

First, do a quick search online for AI tools for university students. 
Examples:
- [How can AI be used by university students?](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/advice/how-can-ai-be-used-university-students)- [The 10 Best AI Tools to Help Students Learn Faster](https://mystudylife.com/10-best-ai-tools-to-help-students-learn-faster/))

Intrigued? Do you find any tech tools that you might use to help you with understanding course topics, studying, generating flashcards, transcribing lectures and voice notes, grammar, writing an essay, creating a slideshow presentation, drafting a forum discussion post, etc.?

Do any of these capabilites concern you?  Do you think they concern your professors or fellow students? 

Review TWU's policy on [Academic Misconduct & Fraud](https://www.twu.ca/about-us/policies-guidelines/university-policies/academic-misconduct-fraud).

Search online for key words related to this issue, such as "university concern policy artificial intelligence" and you will find numerous articles on the use of AI in universities, as well as emerging policies.  For example, the University of Toronto's guidelines for [ChatGPT and Generative AI in the Classroom](https://www.viceprovostundergrad.utoronto.ca/strategic-priorities/digital-learning/special-initiative-artificial-intelligence/)

Here is one more article that discusses the pros and cons for English Learners using AI in their studies: [Perspectives of the Use of ChatGPT as a Tool for Online Education of English](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374483468_Perspectives_of_the_Use_of_ChatGPT_as_a_Tool_for_Online_Education_of_English)

 

```

### Jobs and Automation {-}

In this section we consider the impact of automation on the future job market and the implications for education and training. Consider:

- Will robots replace humans?  
- What jobs are most at risk of being replaced by robots?  
- What are the implications for learning in a digital age?  


### Activity: Impact of Automation & AI in the Workplace {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

First, read [Collaborative Intelligence: Humans and AI Are Joining Forces](https://hbr.org/2018/07/collaborative-intelligence-humans-and-ai-are-joining-forces) from Harvard Business Review.

Next, watch [Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)

<div class ="video-container">

## Topic

Digital Rights Management
In a digital world, you may not have the full ownership rights you expect, or are accustomed to receiving in the physical world, when you buy digital content, resources, and equipment. In this section we explore digital rights management, geoblocking, and other examples. We highlight the importance users have to study the terms of reference and licenses when using proprietary software and buying products that rely on digital technology.

Mini Challenge Summary
Summary: Explore and discuss the impact of digital rights management. Time: 30–45 minutes. Consult the suggested resources and participate in the digital rights management debate.

John Deere 9530 c.jpg
Digital Rights Management (DRM)
Digital rights management (DRM) describes the practice of imposing technical restrictions (hardware or software) to restrict what users can do with the digital content or operation of their equipment. 

Examples include:

Film studios that embed software on their DVDs that restricts the number of copies a legal user can make to two.
Computer games that restrict the number of devices on which the game can be installed requiring server authentication to keep track of the number of installations.
e-Book publishers who restrict the ability to copy or print the materials.
Reading
Layton, J. (Jan. 3, 2006). How Digital Rights Management Works. Retrieved July 4, 2017. (Click on the next button to progress the sub-pages of the article.)
Geoblocking
Geoblocking is a form of DRM which restricts access to content based on geographical location; for example, restrictions associated with media rights for sport coverage or films in different parts of the world because copyright holders sell broadcast and distribution rights to different companies around the world. Frequently, prices for streamed services of the same content will differ from country to country.

In another example, an individual who buys DVD films in one country and then emigrates to another country, may find that the playback of the legally purchased content is restricted by technology means in the new country of residence.

Reading
Geoblocking from Wikipedia;
EU lawmakers Include Spotify and iTunes in Geoblocking Ban from Reuters.
Case study - The Right to Repair
Do farmers have the right to repair their own tractors? Not necessarily, for example, John Deere’s proprietary software used to operate the vehicle does not allow “owners” to repair systems themselves and in effect they only have an implied license for life to operate the vehicle.



Readings
Choose one or two of the following readings (feel free to annotate using Hypothes.is and remember to tag your posts using the course code: lida102):

We Can’t Let John Deere Destroy the Very Idea of Ownership from Wired.
Why American Farmers are Hacking their own Tractors from the Guardian
A Right to Repair: Why Nebraska Farmers are Taking on John Deere and Apple from the Guardian.
The Fight for the “Right to Repair” from Smithsonian.com.
Outputs
Digital Rights Management Debate
Seeing both sides of a debate gives you the opportunity to better understand the issues. In this discussion, choose one of the questions listed below and post to the DRM debate. Your post should include:

A sentence summarizing the issue.
The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is appropriate in a digital world.
The most important reason, in your opinion, why DRM is not appropriate in a digital world.

### Activity: Forum: Philanthropy and corporate advertising  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Read the following case study:

The [OERu](https://oeru.org/) is a charitable organisation which provides open online courses for free, using open educational resources which any educational institution can adopt, modify and reuse. There are costs that need to be covered to sustain the OERu: for example, the assembly of open online courses, hosting of the server and software infrastructure, staff to coordinate and support the initiative. etc. The OERu does not generate any revenue from corporate services, by, for example, allowing advertising on the OERu course sites for a share of the advertising revenue. Moreover, the OERu does not sell or generate revenue from personal data learners provide by using these free learning services, therefore users are not the product of this service.   

**Discussion**

Join the discussion on philanthropy and corporate advertising. The key question is how can non-profit organisations sustain free educational services for those who can’t afford traditional education provision?

Consider the following issues:

- As a learner, how would you feel if the course materials included corporate advertising? If advertising were to be supported, how would you feel if the OERu course sites required you to switch off any ad-blockers before gaining access to the course materials?  
- Is it appropriate for publicly funded institutions and charities working in education to generate revenue from corporate advertising to support and sustain free online services? What are the risks and opportunities?    
- Should education institutions and educational charities accept significant corporate sponsorship in return for profiling proprietary products?  
- The OERu has recommended that learners use free blogging services to share their learning outputs. Many of these services carry advertising. How do you feel about using these services – being the product rather than consumer? Would it be better for OERu to recommend that learners use a paid service without advertising? How would this impact on learners who do not have sufficient funds to afford maintaining a domain of their own?  
- Other?

### Net Neutrality {-}

“	The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past.	”
—Time Berners-Lee


The World Wide Web was originally designed to provide universal access to a large universe of documents. To achieve universal access, it was paramount to design the web as an open system without a central locus of control. However, on the Internet there are an increasing number of “walled gardens” that aim to control user’s access to content and services. In this section we explore the concept of net neutrality and reflect on the risks associated with universal access to online information.



### Activity: The Meaning of Net Neutrality  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Watch [Net Neutrality Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p90McT24Z6w)

<div class ="video-container">

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p90McT24Z6w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> 

</div>

This video was produced in 2015, where the main concern of net neutrality seemed to relate to companies controlling our access to information on the internet.  Notice around the 2 minute mark where opposing political parties are supported/blamed for their view on the topic.)

Fast forward to 2023 where the concern is now government oversight in what information we see.

This issue is highly controversial and politisized.  If you are interested in exploring the topic...which means encountering diverse views on the subject, then read on!  As we learn with technology in this course and in life, we need to critically evaluate the information available on the internet and whether there are any restrictions on information that would help us as citizens to make informed decisions.

If interested, peruse the following resources.  ***Trigger alert!***  These perspective range from liberal to conservative points of view. This course aims to promote critical thinking of what we consume and produce online. Refer back to the video [Building More Creative Social Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acc4zY1sQ0o).  Will encountering an opposing point of view contribute to your understanding of an issue?

Let's dig in to some points on net neutrality!

<details>
<summary>**Facebook Zero: Am Attempt to Bring Access to All?**</summary>

Consider the following case study:

"[Facebook Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Zero) is an application for mobile devices and business agreements with a number of companies to provide access to selected internet services without incurring data charges targeting markets where internet access may be less affordable. Facebook Zero is part of internet.org set up by Facebook and the basic websites than can be accessed for free without data charges are determined by the initiative."

...and then some criticism:

"Facebook Zero became controversial in some countries due to several issues such as net neutrality.[9] For instance, India's Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) bans zero-rated services on account of "discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content”.[13] A criticism also stated that Facebook is practicing digital colonialism because it is not introducing open internet but building a "little web that turns the user into a mostly passive consumer of mostly western corporate content”.[11]"

Is the Internet Neutral in Africa?

[Who really wins from Facebook's 'free internet' plan for Africa?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/who-really-wins-from-facebooks-free-internet-plan-for-africa/)



In addition to the challenges associated with net neutrality, think about how closed technologies can build walled gardens, for example:

- The Apple iOS which is restricted to running pre-approved applications on the hardware purchased by the user.  
- The Amazon Kindle line of e-readers intentionally designed to favour the Amazon commercial ecosystem.  
- Video game consoles that typically require game developers to purchase a license to develop games for the platform frequently requiring approval from the platform prior to publishing the games.

## Digital Wisdom

To conclude our course, we will examine another perspective on ethics and technology.  This may tap into the foundational lens by which you approach many ethical issues, so take a moment to reflect on the following:

- What role does technology play in my social, academic, and spiritual life?
- What guidance does the Bible have on our use of technology today?
- How will my use of technology support my social, academic, and spiritual goals? 
  
### Activity: Digital Wisdom  {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Skim the following article in which the authors present a framework for digital wisdom, as well as practical practices that can help navigate the digital in our daily lives. 

- [A Framework for Digital Wisdom in Higher Education](https://christianscholars.com/a-framework-for-digital-wisdom-in-higher-education/){target="_blank"}

Here are some quotes that resonate with me.  Feel free to highlight your quotes using Hypothes.is, or in your personal Obsidian notes.  

> "Institutions of higher education have a crucial role and responsibility at this moment of technological change to form people who will flourish in our so-called digital age." (para 1)

> "Within the context of Christian higher education, the need to integrate new ICTs into our individual and institutional lives well and wisely—as we consider what technologies are doing to us and what we will do with them—is of utmost significance if we are committed to the cultivation of competence, character, and wisdom." (para 6)

> "Scripture enables us look behind and beyond our and others’ online identities to see ourselves and others as embodied and relational beings made in the image of God." (para 21)

> "Our use of technologies must be shaped by our intentions and values, and we must be aware of how platform interfaces, permissions, algorithms, and other design elements could interfere with our goals and obligations." (para 31)

```
