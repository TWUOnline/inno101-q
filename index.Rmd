### Course Description  {-}

Introduces theories and competencies related to learning and thriving in a digital world. Explores how learners are situated in 'the digital' throughout their lives and how they can use digital technologies to enhance and enrich their experience of learning, working, and playing. Learners will begin to build a curated digital footprint, initiate and develop personal and professional learning networks; develop competencies to allow them to evaluate and choose digital platforms and tools that are safe and ethical; and explore how to use digital technologies to discover, curate, connect, and share knowledge with their communities.

### How To Navigate This Book {-}

Take a moment to experiment with the controls in the toolbar at the top of the page. You can search this book for a word or phrase (for example, to look up a definition). To move quickly to different portions of the book, click on the appropriate chapter or section in the table of contents on the left. The buttons at the top of the page allow you to show/hide the table of contents, search the book, adjust the typeface, the font size, and the background colour to make the text easier to read. 

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="Top menu bar", fig.show="hold", results='asis'}

knitr::include_graphics("assets/course-intro/menu.png")

```

The faint left and right arrows at the sides of each page (or bottom of the page if it’s narrow enough) allow you to step to the next/previous section. Here’s what they look like:

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="Left and right navigation arrows", fig.show="hold", results='asis'}

knitr::include_graphics("assets/course-intro/left_arrow.png")
knitr::include_graphics("assets/course-intro/right_arrow.png")

### Course Technologies{-}

This course is about learning with technology. Digital literacies are closely linked but not limited to digital skills. Consequently, this course will use a number of different online communication and publishing technologies to support your learning.

#### An open philosophy of inclusion {-}

Learning in a digital age incorporates a wide range of online technologies and software applications. The OERu has a strong commitment to free and open source software because we believe that no learner should be denied access to learning for lack of funds to purchase a proprietary software license.  Nor do we believe that you should be forced to sacrifice your freedoms in software choice.

The OERu course resources and interaction technologies are based entirely on free and open source software and you will be able to complete all the learning activities using open source applications without the need to purchase any software. You are free to use proprietary technology applications of your choice, but you can also use this course to explore and experiment with open technology.

#### Summary of technologies used on this course {-}

You do not need a password to access the course materials. However, if you want to post comments and /or receive instructions via email you will need to register an account on the course site by clicking on the “head graphic” at the top of your screen.

Your registration login details will provide you with authenticated access to most of the course technologies hosted by OERu. In some cases you will need to register separate accounts for technologies that are run independently of the LiDA course.

The following table provides a summary of the main technologies used in this course.

| **Technology**       | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

(**Requires separate account registration**)                                                                                |

This is the hub for keeping track of the distributed course interactions on the web. |
| Course resource bank | The [resource bank](https://bookmarks.oeru.org/search.php/all/lida101) is a site used to share web links and summaries of useful resources you find online. We encourage learners to share links publicly with your peers. Remember to vote for links you find useful on the site. Search using the course tag: “LDRS101”                                                                                                                                 |
| Zoom                 | Zoom is a communications platform that allows you to connect via video, audio, phone, or chat. Note the GX Live sessions may use Zoom for the Learning Lab sessions. GX Prime students are encouraged to take advantage of the Learning Hub, which will have weekly Zoom meetings as well. (**Requires separate account registration**)                                                                                                                   |



#### Learn by doing {-}

Some learners will be familiar with these technologies, while others will be using them for the first time. We use a learn by doing approach and you will be prompted in the course materials when to interact with these different technologies.

Initially the use of different technologies distributed on the web may be confusing. However, this is a course about learning on the Internet and once you have completed LiDA, you will become a competent user of these online technologies.

Have fun and enjoy the learning experience.


<!--

@cmadland could I suggest this tech table from https://course.oeru.org/lida101/course-guide/course-technologies/ instead of introducing Hypothes.is instructions here?  



The following tools will be introduced in this course. Feel free to explore the links below, or wait until they are introduced in the particular unit in which the tool is required.

#### Course Annotations{-}

[Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) is our annotation tool. With hypothes.is you can annotate web pages on the Internet as well as keeping private notes when using the highlight feature.

Hypothes.is enables you to:

- Select text to annotate.  
- Add tags and post publicly or save privately.  - 
Reply to or share any annotation.  
- Link to notes or whole pages.  
- Annotate together in groups.  
- Collaborate privately with others.  
- Search your notes.  
- Explore all public annotations and profiles.  


##### How to annotate a web-page {-}

Four steps to annotating web pages using hypothes.is:

Step 1: [Create an account](https://hypothes.is/signup) on the Hypothes.is website.
Step 2: Add Hypothes.is to your browser. ([Install](https://web.hypothes.is/start/#) the add-on for Chrome or bookmarklet for other browsers).
Step 3: Go to any web page, launch Hypothesis (using the Chrome add-on or browser bookmarklet) and log in using the account you created at Hypothes.is.
Step 4: Highlight the text you want to annotate (see [how to highlight text](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001669.htm) published by computerhope.com), click on the “Annotate” button which appears when you highlight the text, type your annotation and click “Post to Public”.
The following video provides a brief overview of how to post an annotation. Watch [Hypothesis Web Annotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFPYqXubTsE)
