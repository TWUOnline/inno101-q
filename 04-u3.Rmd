## Sense-making Through Hyperlinks

In higher education, your task as an undergraduate is to build on the skills you bring from high school and apply those skills in a much more focussed field of study. Previously, you might have been able to succeed in school by having a great memory, but increasingly in university, you will be asked to do much more. You will be required to understand the theoretical basis of ideas (analysis) and also make connections between ideas to create new ideas (synthesis). This may feel challenging at first, but you will learn.

One of the challenges is that there is simply far too much information for you to analyze for any task that you might need to do for an instructor. In a previous unit, you learned some basic skills in finding and managing resources that you will need, and in this unit, you will learn some ways to begin to analyze and synthesize information and documents in a systematic way.

If you learn this workflow well, and learn how to customize it to your needs (that's synthesis), you will be ahead of the game when it comes time to complete papers in other courses.

The key to this component of your workflow is the lowly [hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink). You likely know that if you click or tap on that highlighted word, you will be taken to another website, in this case, the wikipedia article on hyperlinks. That is a hyperlink and it is the most basic unit of the entire internet, which is simply a massive collection of documents all linked together. At it's most basic form, a hyperlink is simply a connection between two documents where a hyperlink in one document allows you to open the second document.

In this workflow, instead of just linking two documents together, you will link two ideas together (by linking documents). Your Obsidian vault is essentially a website that is only accessible on your computer, and instead of links going to documents on other servers, you link to documents within the vault (although you can still link to the web).

### Activity: Digital skills versus literacies {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity, we will review an article on the difference between digital skills and digital literacies using Hypothes.is – an online social annotation technology.


Purpose
Read an online article and annotate it using Hypothes.is.

Tasks

1. Read the Hypothes.is “Quick start guide for students”
1. Create an account on Hypothes.is. Here is the registration link
We recommend that you use the Chrome browser (download here) and install the Hypothes.is extension. Alternatively, you can annotate web pages directly from the Hypothes.is website by pasting the link into the text area after you have logged into the site. If you are working on a mobile device, please follow these instructions: How to use Hypothes.is on mobile devices.
1. Read the following article: Knowing the Difference Between Digital Skills and Digital Literacies, and Teaching Both
1. Activate the annotations after logging in to Hypothes.is and click on the search icon () and enter the course code (LiDA101) to filter posts for this course from the public feed.
1. Annotate or reply to posts by visiting the annotation page (You will need to be logged into the Hypothes.is site to post.)
1. Remember to tag your posts using the course code: LDRS101 (The course tag is required to harvest posts for the course feed.)
