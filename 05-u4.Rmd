# Building a Network of Ideas

## Overview {-}

Welcome to Unit 4!  In previous units, you've been introduced to the world of digital literacies and how to use various tools for organizing and connecting ideas. You have started to build a workflow to help you learn more effectively, and have applied the critical skill of metacognition to explain your process for learning. 

Now, let's delve into the next phase of our learning journey.

In the second half of the course, you will continue to build your digital skills and use critical thinking to record your learning process. Our attention will move from creating a personal collection of ideas to presenting your learning in a more open platform. Remember, you decide how public you want to be. We'll also consider why sharing knowledge is important and explore user-friendly ways to do so while still maintaining your control over your work and handling privacy matters. During this unit, you'll get the chance to create a blog, discover your digital footprint, and assess various digital tools.

### Topics {-}

This unit is divided into the following topics:


1. Personal Learning Environments

## Personal Learning Environments 

The primary purpose of this topic is to enable you to set up your course blog, which will form the hub of your Personal Learning Environment (PLE). Blog posts are a useful way of reflecting on your learning and a means to network with your peers. It also provides our TWU learning community with a way to see how you are engaging with the course and to help where we can. The purpose of a PLE is to put the learner at the centre of the online learning environment, which will be enabled by establishing a personal blog for this course. 

So what is a Personal Learning Environment?

> 'Personal Learning Environments are systems that help learners take control of and manage their own learning. This includes providing support for learners to set their own learning goals, manage their learning; managing both content and process, communicate with others in the process of learning, and thereby achieve learning goals. A PLE may be composed of one or more sub-systems: As such it may be a desktop application, or composed of one or more web-based services.' [PLE Wiki](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Personal_learning_environment)

> A Personal Learning Environment is "a structure and process that helps learners organize the influx of information, resources and interactions that they are faced with on a daily basis into a personalized learning space or experience. In a PLE, the learner develops an individualized digital identity through the perceptual cues and cognitive affordances that the personal learning environment provides, such as what information to share and when, who to share it with, and how to effectively merge formal and informal learning experiences ([Castañeda, Cosgrave, Marín, Cronin, 2016](https://naerjournal.ua.es/article/view/v6n1-introduction#)) cited in [Personal Learning Environments: Research-Based Practices, Frameworks and Challenges](https://naerjournal.ua.es/article/view/v6n1-introduction).

What elements of the two definitions resonate with you?  How do you manage your own learning? How do you organize your daily interations and influx of information? How do you share your learning with others? What are your learning goals? 


### Activity: What is a PLE? {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Before you start building your PLN, read the following article: 
- [“7 Things you should know about personal learning environments"](assets/u4/U4_7-things-you-should-know-about-PLNs.pdf)


<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider</span>

After reading the article, consider the following:

- How do PLNs promote authentic, student-centred learning?
- What are the benefits of a PLN?  How would it benefit you?
- What tools do you currently use as part of your learning environment?

Finally, consider the approach taken at TWU as it supports inquiry-rich learning.  As you watch the short video below, think about how you could use your PLE to enrich your learning at TWU.

```

## Building a Course Blog {-}

In the next activity, you will gain first hand experience in using blog technology for publishing your own course site. You will “declare” yourself online using your PLE (as an alternative to posting an introduction in a closed course forum typically used in a conventional online course). Note that TWU online courses often use Moodle Discussion Forums to facilitate conversations.  By using a platform such as Wordpress, you can retain the contents of your posts, as well as the comments of your peers.  In an LMS (Learning Management System) such as Moodle, you may lose access to what you have posted in discussions, and more importantly, conversations with your peers.  As you create your personal blog in WordPress (or your own selective blog site), you control your data and who can see it.

You will retain control of your data and learning outputs generated during this online course, even after the course is completed.
You get to choose:

- The blog service you would like to use, although **we recommend WordPress as it is supported by TWU**. 
- Whether to accept comments on your blog from your peers
- Whether to register your blog for the aggregated course feed so that any posts tagged with the course code (LDRS101) will be harvested for the feed.


A key teaching philosophy of this course is to embed the acquisition of new digital literacies into your learning journey. Knowledge of how to use the Internet and social media technologies will better prepare you for life in a digital world. If this is your first time blogging, you should spend time in setting up your personal digital learning environment. Please remember that your course blog and the social media technologies you use on this course are public, and that you take full responsibility for anything you publish. Do not disclose any confidential information and respect the privacy of others. In short, don’t say anything that you would not want to read on the Internet.


### Activity: Setting Up Your Course Blog {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

As this is a course focusing on digital literacies, you are asked to establish a course blog, as this will improve your skills and enable you to network with your peers. We recommend using WordPress, as it is supported by TWU.

> We are here to help you create your site, so do not hesitate to ask for technical support. Below you will find a number of resources, but if you get stuck, please reach out on Discourse, or email elearning@twu.ca

To get started on creating your site we suggest the following steps:

<details>
<summary>**1. Sign up to create a website.**</summary>

Go to **create.twu.ca** to sign up for your free WordPress site. Please read all the prompts and instructions carefully!
When you have activated your site (look for a notification to your TWU email), then you are ready to create.  

 </details>

<details>
<summary>**2. Explore your dashboard.**</summary>

The dashboard is the initial area you see when you log in to TWU Create. It’s the center for your site management and where you create content. From the Dashboard you can navigate to content, settings, themes, plugins, and more.

When logged in to TWU Create, you will always have access to an **admin menu** visible on your sites. From the menu item that is the name of the blog (second from left), you can find the link to the dashboard. While in the dashboard, the same menu can be used to return to the front view of your site.

Determine the difference between the dashboard used for editing and the published view of your blog. (It is important to know the difference because, when you register your blog for the course feed, you must use the url for the public view of your blog).
- Do you know how to open the published (public view) of your blog in a new window?
- Have you added a browser bookmark to your dashboard and public version of your blog?

**Help Tips:** When you are in the site administration area of your site, you can get tips on what you are doing by clicking the “Help” menu on the top-right corner. Click on "Help" and read through the Overview describing the elements of the dashboard.

 </details>


<details>
<summary>**3. Review your settings.**</summary>

Review and customise your blog settings from the dashboard according to your preferences. Start by **changing your Site Title** under Settings>General. You need to hit the “Save” button to save your changes. (More information about General Settings here.)
- We recommend that you enable categories and tags on your blog.
- Consider whether you want to moderate all comments or, in the case of WordPress, you can also enable previously approved posters to post comments without moderation. Conduct a web search on “moderating blog comments” to find out more about the pros and cons on the flow of information when moderating comments.

Visit the appearance option on your dashboard and **personalise your blog** by:
- Changing: your theme, header image, background colours and/or image
- Add at least one widget to your blog — remember “less is more“. One or two of the following are functional choices: Archives, recent posts, categories or category cloud, and blogs I follow.

 </details>

<details>
<summary>**4. Add a page & a post.**</summary>

To add a new Page or Post, click the Pages or Posts menu option and then click the Add New link underneath.  Another way is to hover your cursor over Pages or Posts and click the Add new link in the fly-out menu.

**Edit a Page:** Complete your personal details for display on the “About” page of your blog.
- Can you see the updates on your “about” page in the published view of your blog?


**Edit a Blog Post:**  Reflect on your experience of this activity on creating a blog.
Click on “save draft” (so you can review before publishing live on the web). Your reflection could for example:
- Introduce yourself and reflect on what you would like to achieve by maintaining a blog to support your learning
- Reflect on what you thought of the activity; Was it easy or hard?
- Share links to any additional resources you found useful in completing the tasks.
- Provide tips for future learners who will be completing this activity. If you were to set up a new blog again, what would you do differently?
- Add anything your readers may find interesting or useful.

 </details>

<details>
<summary>**5. Add media.**</summary>

**Choose a photo** to add to your blog post. 
- Be sure you have permission to upload the photo.  We sugest using an open licence site, such as [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), or [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=pho&license=2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C9)
- Alternatively, upload your own photo, take a selfie or ask someone to take a photo of you working on this blog post challenge.
- Optional: Record a short video introduction and embed this in your blog post.


 </details>


<details>
<summary>**6. Publish!**</summary>

Review your draft post and, when you’re happy with what you’ve written, click on the **“Publish post”** button.

 </details>

<details>
<summary>**7. Share your blog**</summary>

Add a **category** or **tag** for your post using the course tag: LDRS101

Post in the **LDRS 101 Discourse forum** to let your peers know the web address of your blog and ask them to post a comment. This will give you the opportunity to experience how comments function on your blog and to test if they are working properly.

## Online Identity for Learning 

add intro paragraph

[Your digital footprint matters](https://www.internetsociety.org/learning/digital-footprints/), published by the Internet Society.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro_LlRg8rGg&t=1s - Four Reasons to Care About Your Digital Footprint



Julia Angwin, author of “Dragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security, and Freedom in a World of Relentless Surveillance” attempted to erase her digital footprint.

### Activity: Digital Footprint Audit {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

In this activity you will audit your own digital footprint in order to find out what exists on the internet about you, and reflect on what you want your online identity to be.  Follow the steps below to begin.

1. Conduct a Google search of your own name (using an incognito or private window in Chrome or Firefox). Search for your first name and surname without parenthesis (for example: snow white) and then with parenthesis (for example: “snow white”). Explore the results of your search.
1. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of current and previous employers.
1. Conduct a Google search of your name with the name of previous schools you attended.
1. Expand your search to include social media sites, for example: “snow white” twitter; “snow white” facebook; “snow white” youtube etc.
1. Note any interesting or surprising findings.

<span class="blockhead">Questions to Consider</span>

After watching the video, consider the following:

- ...

```



### Activity: Blog: My Digital Footprint {-}

```{block2, type='reflect'}

Prepare and publish a short blog post of about 250 to 300 words focusing on what you hope to achieve with your online digital identity for learning. Your post can include:

1. Optional reflection: You may want to include a reflection(s) on the outcomes of your footprint audit. Remember that your blog post is public, so only share what you are comfortable sharing with the world. You don’t need to be specific; for example, you can generalise: I am satisfied with my digital footprint because … or I would like to improve my digital footprint for learning because …

1. Professional versus private: Consider how you want to separate your “private” online identity from your professional and / or learning identity. If you already maintain an online presence (existing blog, twitter and/or facebook accounts) think about how you will separate professional / learning posts from private and social life interactions online. For example, maintaining a separate course or learning blog is one way to achieve this distinction. Will you link your personal online identities (e.g.an existing Twitter username or Facebook account) with your learning blog? Will you link your professional online identity (e.g. published online biography on your employer’s web site) with your learning blog?

1. Objectives: List a few objectives for developing or improving your online identity.

1. Remember to add a category or tag to your post using the course tag: LDRS101 (This is needed to harvest links to posts from registered course blogs for the course feed.)

Remember: You are in charge of what you post online and deciding what you would like to share for your digital identity for the purposes of this course. Don’t share high risk personal details like physical address, date of birth, name of first pet etc., which may make it easier for identity thieves to appear more credible. If unsure, consult online resources for internet safety; for example Netsafe New Zealand. (replace resource)

!! Note that we will cover online identity in more depth in Unit 5.
