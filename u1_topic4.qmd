## 1.4 Digital Privacy and Safety {.unnumbered}

Now that you have assessed some of your digital skills or literacies, let's focus our attention on privacy and safety. In this section we summarize important practices as a reminder to remain vigilant in protecting your privacy and security online. If you are unsure about good security practices, there are a wealth of online resources you can (and should) consult.

#### Privacy {.unnumbered}

Your privacy is fragile, easy to lose instantaneously, and difficult to retrieve in an environment that requires so much online interaction.

-   [**Identity theft**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft){target="_blank"} happens, frequently.
    -   Never put your social insurance number, your birthday, your mother's maiden name, or any other personal facts anywhere online. Everyone on the internet will be able to access this information.
    -   Always assume that anything you write online (including email) can, and probably will, eventually leak. Keep your email address private---to avoid receiving spam. If your email is published in a plain form anywhere online, even if it is part of an archived email list, spammers will "harvest" it for their databases.
-   **Spam email [(at least half of all email being sent)](https://securelist.com/spam-report-2019/96527/){target="_blank"}** is an unfortunate fact of our modern lives.
    -   If you must publish your email address online, consider creating a "sacrificial" email address, or one you only use to publish online. You can create an email "alias" which you can set to automatically forward to your primary email, and easily disable if your spam volumes increases. Many email services will automatically generate random email addresses that you can use to hide your true address.
    -   Another approach is to avoid publishing the email address as something like *mailto:myname\@somewebdomain.net*. Instead, you might use more confusing text, such as myname-at-somewebdomain-net. Some websites support using these types of obfuscation methods, but the spammers who "scrape" email addresses from websites to populate their spam databases use increasingly sophisticated methods to defeat these methods.
    -   Basically, avoid publishing the email addresses you value online to decrease the amount of spam you receive.

#### Passwords {.unnumbered}

What about passwords? Many people have just one, or maybe a few. Given the number of websites and web services which require password-based authentication, this is not good enough to avoid an identity disaster.

The problem with having only a few passwords is that even resource-rich and security-critical organizations have [suffered massive leaks](https://gizmodo.com.au/2017/05/over-560-million-passwords-discovered-in-anonymous-online-database/){target="_blank"}. If even one of them suffers a data leak, identity thieves will obtain your password and try to use it on other websites. It is easy for them to do this using computer technologies.

Other ways someone can get your password include:

-   Sniffing traffic when you log in to a nonsecure website that uses http:// rather than https:// (the "s" stands for secure because your data transmission's encrypted). Look for the Lock icon.png in your address bar.
-   Sniffing emails---your email, unless encrypted, is not secure. Never send a login and password along with the web address of a service (similarly, don't send credit card numbers).
-   [Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing){target="_blank"} attacks---where someone sends you an email that looks like it is from a trusted sender, such as from a friend, your bank, an online store you frequent, or a government agency, and asks you to enter your password to confirm it. No one should ever ask you to enter your password via email.
-   Always check the web address (hover over the link) to make sure it corresponds to the right place or call the sender to confirm the request over the phone.
-   Brute force---hackers often use computers to guess your password, beginning with a list of [common passwords](https://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords){target="_blank"}, and try different combinations until they get it right, or until the system locks them out for trying too many times.
-   "How secure is my password" sites---you should avoid these sites and never type your password into a website or email response that is not appropriate, especially when you know the sender also knows your email.
-   Once your email and any password combination are known, identity thieves will try to use them at various websites, because they know most people only use a few passwords. A thief who discovers a password you created for a website you rarely use will try to compromise the security of a website that is important to you such as your email system, your workplace, social media accounts, or bank account.

Here is a table that shows how quickly passwords can be cracked using brute force methods. Note that the best passwords are both long and include a mix of numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and symbols.

There are services you can use to check if your email is part of a leaked password data set. So, what can you do to protect yourself?

#### Password Managers {.unnumbered}

Get a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager){target="_blank"}. They are incredibly helpful and convenient now that many of us use several computers and mobile devices. Password managers help you manage your passwords.

-   When you choose a password manager make sure you create one [strong password](https://www.howtogeek.com/195430/how-to-create-a-strong-password-and-remember-it/){target="_blank"}, such as a full sentence with some numbers and special characters. This is all you need to remember---the password manager remembers the others. The ensures you generate a different, fully random password for each website you use that requires a password.
-   Good password managers only ever store your details in an encrypted form, where even the company that stores it cannot see your passwords. To access your passwords, you log into the password manager service using your single, strong password (via a secure web link---usually the default, but always check!).
-   There are many [password manager options](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=password+managers&bshm=rimc/1){target="_blank"}. Some widely used proprietary options include [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/){target="_blank"} and [1password](https://1password.com/){target="_blank"}. Open source options also exist, such as [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/){target="_blank"}. Sadly, some of the most popular password managers have suffered from software bugs that have exposed user passwords.

### 1.4.1 Activity: Get a Password Manager {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="20"}
If you don't already use a password manager, set up an account with [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/){target="_blank"}, [1password](https://1password.com/){target="_blank"}, or the free password manager, [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/){target="_blank"}, to familiarize yourself with how password managers work.

1.  Read [*How to Start Using a Password Manager*](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-start-using-password-manager/){target="_blank"} (2021).
2.  Create an account on the password manager site and establish a master password (conduct an online search for advice on choosing a secure master password).
3.  Install the browser extension for your local browser.
4.  Choose one of the TWU course websites and set up a new secure password using your password manager.
5.  Log out of the TWU course website and log in again using the password manager.
6.  Install the mobile phone app for your operating system, and desktop application for your computer (if this applies). Synchronize the local app with your online vault.

Consider using the password manager for your online accounts so you can easily set up and maintain a unique password for each online account you use.

#### Good Messaging Hygiene {.unnumbered}

Always assume that anyone can and will read anything you write in an email. Email is not a secure form of communication. Few people encrypt their email because it is an extra step that even the most technically inclined users are reluctant to take. Both sender and recipient have to be technically proficient.

Text messages and instant messaging programs such as Facebook Messenger are also insecure. Anyone, including government officials and the organization that runs the service, such as Facebook employees, can read it.

#### Secure Your Own Privacy {.unnumbered}

Never send any sensitive data such as your social insurance number, credit card number, password, or other personal information via email or text. Call the person to provide this information over the phone.

You can use a secure, encrypted text message service such as Signal if necessary. It is available at no cost, works on most platforms, and encrypts text messages on your phone. If you text someone else with Signal installed, the entire transaction is encrypted.

#### Secure the Privacy of Others {.unnumbered}

Another element of good digital hygiene is to protect the identity of others. For example, never send group emails using To: or CC: (carbon copy) for each email address. You will reveal the email addresses for everyone on your list. This is especially problematic if you or another person saves the email message and displays it on the web, such as in a mailing list archive. This makes it easy for spammers and hackers to access and download all of those email addresses.

Use BCC: (blind carbon copy), to hide the email addresses from your recipients to protect everyone's privacy. Use your own email address, and BCC the rest of the recipients, if your email software requires you to insert an email address into the To: box.

When using an email mailing list where you send messages to a single email address to a list of people, never CC: someone else in the same message. This will compromise the privacy of every CC'd recipient and the privacy of the list. Always check with the people on the list to ensure you are not taking unacceptable liberties.

If someone asks you to share an email address of a friend or colleague you should ask permission to share their email address, and state why the third party is requesting their email.

#### Be a Thoughtful Sceptic {.unnumbered}

So how can we protect ourselves if new threats are emerging all the time?

-   Be conscious of where you put information that is "private" to you.
-   Beware of the terms of service (ToS) of social media providers such as Facebook. Use a service such as [*Terms of Service: Didn't Read* (TOSDR)](https://tosdr.org/){target="_blank"} to help identify risky, overreaching services. You may be able to use certain privacy settings to protect your information.
-   Always check the identity of a website before you enter any passwords or personal information. Secure certificates are generally trustworthy but be sure to check the names and details.
-   Always ask whether you should trust a provider or a government agency. Always ask "who benefits when I do this?" What are their incentives?
-   Protect your own data and be even more protective of others' private information. For example, be cautious before posting information about yourself or someone else. Be especially cautious when posting pictures or videos of their children.
-   Remember, complacency and unwarranted trust are your biggest enemies. A healthy paranoia is good for your digital health. Think about the great amount of time and effort it will take to regain your identity (and credit rating) if your information is compromised.

### 1.4.2 Activity: Analyzing Terms of Service (Didn't Read) {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="20"}
Use the [*Terms of Service: Didn't Read*](https://tosdr.org/){target="_blank"} [@TermsServiceDidn] site to look up each of the apps we will learn in this course. Each tool currently has its own file in your Obsidian vault with a template ready to go for you. Fill out the template for each tool based on what is available on tosdr.org and your own examination of the ToS for each tool.

Feel free to add components to the template. Note we're return to this website at the end of Unit 4 as we evaluate digital tools.

### 1.4.3 Activity: Introduction To Reflective Journaling {.unnumbered}

::: {.learning-activity time="10"}
For the final activity of Unit 1 you will be asked to write a reflective journal entry in Obsidian on the topic of digital literacy. This entry can be used as part of **Assignment 1: Reflective Journal**.

Prior to completing this activity, let's discuss the practice of writing in a Reflective Journal.

A reflective journal is simply a record of your thoughts. It is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you respond to your learning. Journals can consist of traditional note taking, mind maps, pictures, stream-of-consciousness writing, recordings, quotes, sketches, or drawings---whatever you choose to include. Experiment and have fun. The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course's readings, activities, and discussions. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. Throughout the course, we will remind you to write in your journal, as we want to be sure you are actively learning the material. To assist you, we have provided you with questions you can ask yourself in order to get your creative energies flowing. Reflective journaling is an activity you can and should complete on a regular or daily basis, even beyond the prompting in course activities.

[Watch: *Reflective Writing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoI67VeE3ds){target="_blank"} (2014)

{{< video https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QoI67VeE3ds >}}

Here are some common questions used for reflective journaling. As you read them, consider what you have learned in this first unit.

-   In your view, what were the most important points in the readings or activities?
-   What information did you already know? What skills did you already have?
-   What new knowledge, skills, or perspectives have you gained?
-   What information was easy to remember or learn? Why?
-   What concepts or skills did you find more difficult? Why?
-   How can you apply this knowledge to your studies or future career?
-   How has this knowledge helped you to make sense of your current or previous experience?
-   Has your understanding of a personal or work-related situation changed after studying these concepts?
-   Did you agree or disagree with any of the material? If yes, how did you react and why?
-   If you could have the opportunity to engage in further learning, what would it be?
-   What further questions would like to ask about the concepts presented in this unit?
-   What other concepts, resources or discussions would be of interest?
