## Sense-making Through Hyperlinks

In higher education, your task is to build on the skills you bring from your previous experience and apply those skills in a much more focused field of study. Previously, you might have been able to succeed in school by having a great memory, but increasingly, you will be asked to do much more. You will be required to understand the theoretical basis of ideas (analysis) and also make connections between ideas to create new ideas (synthesis). This may feel challenging at first, but you will learn.

One of the challenges is that there is simply far too much information for you to analyze for any task that you might need to do for an instructor. In a previous unit, you learned some basic skills in finding and managing resources that you will need and in this unit, you will learn some ways to begin to analyze and synthesize information and documents in a systematic way.

If you learn this workflow well and learn how to customize it to your needs (that's synthesis), you will be ahead of the game when it comes time to complete papers in other courses.

The key to this component of your workflow is the lowly [hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink){target="_blank"}. You'll know that if you click or tap that highlighted word you will be taken to another website, in this case, the Wikipedia article on hyperlinks. That is a hyperlink and it is the most basic unit of the entire internet, which is simply a massive collection of documents all linked together. At its most basic form, a hyperlink is simply a connection between two documents where a hyperlink in one document allows you to open the second document.

In this workflow instead of just linking two documents together you will link two ideas together (by linking documents). Your Obsidian vault is essentially a website that is only accessible on your computer; instead of links going to documents on other servers, you link to documents within the vault (although you can still link to the web).

### Linking in Obsidian {.unnumbered}

There are two methods of building hyperlinks in Obsidian: Wikilinks and markdown links, and we will cover both here.

#### Wikilinks {.unnumbered}

A Wikilink, the default in Obsidian, is really simple to build. All you have to do is type two opening square brackets, like this `[[`, and Obsidian will do a couple things automatically. First, Obsidian will create the closing brackets to match, so you end up with this `[[]]`, with your cursor in the middle, and second, Obsidian will present a list of all the pages in your vault, from which you can choose the page you want linked.

::: {#fig-wikilink}

![](assets/u3/wikilink.png){fig-alt="Screenshot, how to create a Wikilink in Obsidian" .lightbox fig-align="left"}

Once you choose a page (in this case, article1.md), Obsidian will do the rest, and you will end up with this view:

::: {#fig-wikilink2}

![](assets/u3/wikilink2.png){fig-alt="Screenshot showing Wikilink "article1.md" created in Obsidian" .lightbox fig-align="left"}

:::

From Hypothes.is you can create a link to Zotero. By pressing and holding the "Command" (macOS) or "CTRL" (Windows) button on the keyboard and then hovering over the link you've created, you will get a preview of the Zotero page. If you press and hold the "Command" (macOS) or "CTRL" (Windows) button on the keyboard and then click the link, you will be taken to the page. Once on the Zotero page, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and see "Backlinks" (a link back to the original page). If you don't see backlinks, click the three dots in the top right corner of the page and choose "Backlinks in document."

#### Markdown Links {.unnumbered}

While Wikilinks are the default in Obsidian and are the easiest way to link within your vault, sometimes you might want to link to a site on the web. The syntax for a markdown link is a bit different but is still very simple. There are two parts you need to remember:

- the link text (this is what you want your reader to see on your page)
- the link URL (this is the web address of the site you want them to visit)

Here is the syntax: `[Link text between single square brackets](URL inside parentheses){target="_blank"} So if you want someone to see the word "YouTube" on the page and for them to be taken to the YouTube website when they click the link, the syntax would be `[YouTube](https://youtube.com){target="_blank"}` which will display like this: [YouTube](https://youtube.com){target="_blank"}. Notice that there are no spaces between the closing square bracket and the opening parenthesis.

<!-- //todo -->Here is the syntax: `[Link text between single square brackets](URL inside parentheses){target="_blank"}` So if you want someone to see the word "YouTube" on the page and for them to be taken to the YouTube website when they click the link, the syntax would be `[YouTube](https://youtube.com){target="_blank"}` which will display like this: [YouTube](https://youtube.com){target="_blank"}. Notice that there are no spaces between the closing square bracket and the opening parenthesis.

### Why Link? {.unnumbered}

Creating links to other related topics in your notes is a way that you can start to build connections in your mind about how different ideas are related. For example, if you are studying "trees," you might want to link over to the previous notes that you created on "plants," "forests," or "climate change." During your study on trees, you might want to create notes on "deciduous" and "coniferous" trees, or "xylem" and "phloem," and link those articles to "trees." By continually linking notes that are related you are creating a web of your knowledge as well as reminders of how ideas are related. Linking is a way for you to make sense of the information that is coming into your consciousness.

Once you have created links between different files in your vault you can visualize these links using the "Graph View" in Obsidian. Here is part of the graph view for a major paper. Each of the white dots represents a file in the vault, and their size is relative to the number of pages linked to that article. You can see that there are three really big pages that have many links. Those are clearly very important pages.

### Activity: Link, Connect, and Reflect

::: {.learning-activity}

- **Link**: Follow the directions above to add notes to Obsidian on a topic of interest. Search online for interesting articles and videos you want to add to your notes and practice adding them using Wikilinks and markdown links. Locate the graph view in Obsidian to see the connections between the ideas you've added.

- **Write**: After spending some time practicing this new skill, write a reflective journal entry on the process you followed and what your experience was like. What did you struggle with? How did you troubleshoot? What are the advantages of organizing your notes using this method?

Feel free to discuss your experience on the [Learning Hub](https://twu.discourse.group/auth/microsoft_office365){target="_blank"} in Discourse. You can also post any questions you have about this process and get technical support from your instructors and facilitators.

## Sense-making Through Tags

A tag is a very short, descriptive word or phrase you can apply to an idea. You are likely familiar with the idea of a hashtag (`#``)` from various social media apps as a way to quickly find information on a specific topic. A tag in Obsidian works just like a hashtag in social media. If you type `#trees` on a file about trees, and then do the same on your pages about xylem, phloem, climate change, plants, forests, deciduous, and coniferous, you could click that tag on any one of those pages, and Obsidian will find every page that contains that tag.

This acts like a super-fast search of your notes for a particular topic or ideas related to a topic.

We recommend that you put your tags in the same spot on each page so you know where to find them. You can also put those tags at any place in your notes and Obsidian will show you the specific spot in your notes where the tag lives.

You can also show tags in your graph view, as below. Green dots are tags and white dots are files (as before). You can see in this image that there are many more connections.

:::

Using links and tags together you can build a very powerful and easily searchable vault of all the ideas in your courses. This can be incredibly valuable when it is time to write a paper or prepare for an exam---you can have all your notes easily accessible rather than having to search through pages and pages of handwritten notes.

### Activity: Tag, Link, Connect, and Reflect

::: {.learning-activity}

- **Tag**: Follow the directions above to add tags to your notes in Obsidian. Again, spend some time on this. The more you practice, the easier the process will be. More than that, as you continue to use tags and links, you will be able to experience the advantages of connecting your ideas using this method.
- **Write**: Add to your Reflective Journal your thoughts and experience on using tags. What were your struggles or "ah-ha" moments? What questions do you have? Remember to reach out for support on the Learning Hub in Discourse.

## Sense-making Through Concept Maps

As you saw at the beginning of this unit, sense-making is the **work** of learning. There is no way around the work of learning because learning is work. It takes time and cognitive effort. As much as we wish to be able to "learn" like Neo in *The Matrix*, we can't (see a favourite scene in a movie, below; and it's not just because Keanu Reeves is the GOAT 🐐).

- **Watch**: [The Matrix - 'I Know Kung Fu'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YhJxJZOWBw){target="_blank"} (2019)

{{< video https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0YhJxJZOWBw >}}

Tags and links in Obsidian can be visualized using graph view, but as this is an algorithmically generated map of the connections between ideas and files in your vault, there is little you can do to customize it. Fortunately, Obsidian also features a tool called the Canvas, which is a blank space that you can use to manually connect ideas in a visual format, allowing you to see connections and relationships that make sense to you. The following video is a brief explanation of how to use the Canvas in Obsidian.

### Activity: Obsidian Concept Map

- **Watch**: [*Mind Mapping in Obsidian Canvas*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHI-Szjpafk){target="_blank"} (2023). As you watch, follow the directions and to create a concept map in Obsidian. You will use this in the next activity.

{{< video https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eHI-Szjpafk >}}

### Activity: Open Source Video and Audio Lectures

::: {.learning-activity}

- **Search**: Search for a video or audio lecture on a topic of interest. Use your advanced search skills or browse the following sites to find a suitable recording aligned with your interests:
  - [*Open Culture*](https://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses){target="_blank"} (2024). Over 30,000 hours of free audio and video lectures
  - [*Open Yale Courses*](https://oyc.yale.edu/){target="_blank"} (2024). Free and open access to a selection of introductory courses including video lectures from Yale University(2024). 
  - [*Harvard Online Courses*](https://extension.harvard.edu/online-learning/){target="_blank"}(2024) Series of video lectures from Harvard University.
  - [*MIT OpenCourseWare*](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?f=Lecture%20Videos&f=Lecture%20Audio&s=department_course_numbers.sort_coursenum){target="_blank"}(2024) Series of audio and video lectures from Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  - [*Tedx Talks*](https://www.ted.com/){target="_blank"} (2024). Extensive database of video presentations in the form of short, powerful talks (see also list of topics)

- **Write**: Using Obsidian, record your notes from the lecture. 
  - the first line is used for the title of the note
  - remember to include a link to the source of the information
  - use tags and links to connect your ideas

## Reading and Note Taking

Next, let's focus on reading and note taking. In this section, you will demonstrate your note taking skills based on reading an academic publication. You will also have the opportunity to practice using the Markdown markup language. Semantic markup is an important digital skill that separates formatting (e.g., headings, bold, italics, lists) from content, using designated characters without the use of rich text editors. This provides the capability to use plain text files that can be converted to formatted text online. Markdown is one of many such markup protocols and is used here to demonstrate the principles of semantic markup.

### Activity: Reading and Note Taking

::: {.learning-activity}

- **Read** the following articles and take notes in Obsidian. Try using Markdown to format your text.
  - [*Effective Reading and Note-Taking*](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/effective-reading-and-note-taking){target="_blank"} (n.d.)
  - [*Reading for Understanding: The SQW3R Method*](https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/reading-understanding){target="_blank"} (2024)
  - [*How to (Seriously) Read a Scientific Paper*](https://www.science.org/content/article/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper){target="_blank"} (2016)
  - *Using Markdown in Obsidian* (n.d.)

:::

### Activity: Writing a Summary of Your Readings

::: {.learning-activity}

In this activity you will read an academic article and write a summary using Obsidian and Zotero.

- **Read**:
  - First, search for a peer reviewed journal article in support of a research topic of interest
  - Remember to add the source to your citation management tool, Zotero
- **Write**:
  - Prepare a summary of the journal article based on this example
  - Use the Markdown formatting in Obsidian. Your summary must at a minimum demonstrate the following text formats:
    - headings and subheadings
    - bold and italics
    - numbered or unordered list
    - labelled link
    - horizontal rule
    - block quote for one or more citations from the article
  -  Copy your summary prepared in Obsidian and paste this text summary into Zotero using the notes feature so that you have a copy for your personal library as backup.

Reflect on your progress in practicing these digital skills. Share your thoughts in your journal and/or in Discourse.
